THE LAST SWIM
Draft 11.8 (w/ Farsi)

Sasha Nathwani & Helen Simmons
Copyright 2023EXT. THE EARTH FROM SPACE 1 1
We are flying toward the Earth alongside the soothing voice 
of ZIBA SOOFI.
Opening sequence choreographed to Intro Sequence by Federico 
Albanese.
ZIBA (O.S.)
There’s a picture of Earth... from 
space. It’s called The Blue Marble. 
Sorry, I’m sure you already know 
this.
PROFESSOR WALTERS (O.S.)
Yes, but go on... 
ZIBA (O.S.)
Well as a kid I would just stare at 
it for hours. Just fascinated by 
this thing - which we were also 
living on... - that looked so 
simple, serene, beautiful. But it 
wasn’t simple, it was an incredibly 
complex thing. I guess that’s what 
sparked me wanting to know more and 
led me here. 
SHOT: CLOSE-UP DETAILS OF “THE BLUE MARBLE”
PROFESSOR WALTERS (O.S.)
What did the image make you want to 
know, or find out? 
ZIBA (O.S.)
Well I was surprised when I 
realised the earth is mostly water - 
which seemed insane. And then just 
how fragile and small we look, 
sitting there in the middle of the 
vastness of space.
INT. UCL TUTOR ROOM - AFTERNOON - CONTINUOUS 2 2
A young woman, 17, olive skin, long curly dark hair over her 
light grey school uniform, sits in an office chair with a 
visitor pass around her neck. This is Ziba. 
Ziba sits, poised and composed, opposite a PROFESSOR WALTERS, 
late 30s, bespectacled and intimidatingly smart.2.ZIBA
And from then on I just had this 
hunger to understand why, how... 
Like so much of life is a total 
mystery, unquantifiable... but then 
this. Astrophysics is where we can 
quantify it. Make sense of it. 
Understand it.
PROFESSOR WALTERS 
Well we try our best... We err 
further away from the philosophical 
than some of our rival courses... 
But what we lack in pondering we 
make up for in hardcore physics. Do 
you feel ready for the rigour of 
the course? It can be intense -
ZIBA
I’m intense. I mean - I’m not 
intense but I like to work... 
intensely.
Professor Walters smiles, nods. 
PROFESSOR WALTERS
Well that’s good to hear. 
(beat)
And why here?
ZIBA
Well you’re the biggest department 
in the country. You have 
connections with industry, do 
groundbreaking research... 
PROFESSOR WALTERS
And you won’t settle for anything 
less than best?
ZIBA
Something like that. 
The tutor pushes his glasses up his nose and looks at her. 
Ziba smiles.
INT. ZIBA’S FIRST HOME TOILET - FLASHBACK - CONTINUOUS 3 3
A six-year-old Ziba, her bushy hair hanging just over her 
bright green eyes, sits on the toilet. She stares straight 
down the barrel. 
SHOT: We zoom into her concentrated expression2.3.ZIBA (O.S.)
The course modules are so exciting 
to me. I really would just love to 
delve in - and by year 3 - have a 
broad overview and be ready for the 
coursework. I’ve already got an 
inkling that Ocean Physics and 
Climate Change might be for me. Or 
maybe Fluid Mechanics. 
SHOT: ZOOM-OUT OF THE BLUE MARBLE
INT. UCL TUTOR ROOM - AFTERNOON 4 4
PROFESSOR WALTERS
You’ve done your research (looking 
down), Zee-ber... 
ZIBA
Zee-bah. It’s Persian.
PROFESSOR WALTERS
So does anyone in your family have 
an interest in astrophysics?
ZIBA
No. I mean not in my school either. 
PROFESSOR WALTERS
And you live here in London? 
ZIBA
Yep. I think my mum likes the idea 
of UCL cause she could still harass 
me. 
They both laugh. Out of nowhere: 
PROFESSOR WALTERS
What’s the Hubble constant? 
Ziba is caught off guard. 
ZIBA
Uh, the um. Sorry, can you repeat 
the question?
PROFESSOR WALTERS
The Hubble constant. What is it? 
The equation.3.4.ZIBA
I mean it’s slightly up for 
debate...
PROFESSOR WALTERS
It is. But the present day 
parameter as written.
ZIBA
Uh... H0 = 100hkm s­1Mpc­1.
PROFESSOR WALTERS
Correct. And why does it keep 
changing?
ZIBA
The Cepheid date and the European 
Space Agency’s Planck satellite 
gathered different measurements... 
and then the study of the red giant 
stars in 2019 fell somewhere in the 
middle. 
(beat)
It’s yet another question we need 
to solve.
Professor Walters smiles. Ziba breathes. 
PROFESSOR WALTERS
Right, let’s end on a fun bonus 
question... because despite what 
our BA colleagues like to say, we 
DO enjoy a bit of fun every now and 
then in the Physics Department...
(mock Mastermind 
intensity)
Do you know which spacecraft the 
Blue Marble photograph was taken 
from? 
ZIBA
Apollo 17. On it’s journey to the 
moon. There have been subsequent 
whole earth images since then, but 
those were taken by unmanned 
spacecrafts. Ask me another one. 
Ziba double blinks in recognition that she might be coming 
off as smug.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
If you like. 4.5.The tutor smiles and jots down some notes. A relieved Ziba 
crosses her legs.
EXT. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON - DUSK 5 5
Ziba exits a large building of UCL, walks through an exit 
gate, stopping, to unchain her bike. 
EXT. REGENT’S PARK - DUSK 6 6
SHOT: We’re flying above the tree line of Regent’s Park, 
descending until we’re next to Ziba, now wearing a beanie and 
scarf over her light grey school uniform.
She seems content, excited.  
In a long uninterrupted drone shot we follow Ziba as she 
slaloms from side to side along the leaf-strewn path. She 
cycles past a variety of characters: a woman breast feeds her 
newborn baby on a park bench, a line of children on a trip to 
the zoo stroll down in single file, a mixed group running 
club overtake Ziba, a middle aged couple stroll past holding 
hands. Men, women and children go about their business in the 
quiet serenity of a beautiful autumnal day in London. Ziba 
grinds to a halt, stopping to take in the view. We linger 
behind her to reveal of a striking pink sunset behind 
London’s BT Tower. 
SMASH CUT TO:
INT. ZIBA’S HOUSE, BATHROOM - MORNING - SIX MONTHS LATER 7 7
Ziba’s head bursts out the bathwater. She pants 
uncontrollably, gasping for air, her thick hair across her 
forehead, over her eyes and down onto her face, appearing 
more like a cavewoman than the graceful young lady from the 
previous scene. 
FADE UP TITLE: LAST SWIM
Ziba continues to gasp for oxygen, moving her hair from her 
vision. 
SUPERIMPOSE: 6 months later
She leaves the bath.
INT. ZIBA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING 8 8
Track: Daughter by Four Tet.5.6.Ziba, cloaked in a green robe, perches on the edge of her bed 
in what is a tidy, well-ordered bedroom. Above her bed hangs 
a large film poster of the sci-fi film Gattaca, amongst 
smaller cutouts of Iranian women, notably one of Mahsa Amini 
alongside the slogan “Woman. Life. Freedom”.
A shaft of sunlight from the small gap in the curtains falls 
onto Ziba’s face. 
She turns to look at her alarm clock - 07:59 - amongst a 
handful of pill containers on her bedside table. Before it 
even has a chance to complete its first ring, she’s turned it 
off, and grabbed a pill container. On the screen, in text, 
flashes 08:00 as the clock changes in sync. 
MONA (SUBTITLED) (O.S)
Zibi Joon, are you awake? 
Ziba goes to shut the door.
INT. ZIBA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 9 9
Ziba is now sat at her desk and pulls open the top drawer. 
She places onto the table:
A spoon. Pill container. Whiskey miniature.
With a table spoon she crushes the pills, then slides them 
into the miniature bottle with a folded train ticket. She 
puts on the cap and gives it a shake. She watches the powder 
swirl slowly through the brown liquid. 
SHOT: C/U of ZIBA’s concentrated expression as she stares at 
the miniature bottle. She places it in a make-up bag, which 
she stuffs into her BACKPACK.
SHOT: Bird’s eye view of her open drawer revealing an 
envelope which reads “Maaman”. 
Ziba’s phone BUZZES. She slams the drawer shut. 
She plonks herself down onto her rug, phone in hand. The text 
message exchange appears on-screen.
ZIBA (TEXT)
Sorry I didn’t make it out. Wanted 
to save my juice for today.
TARA (TEXT)
You excited?
ZIBA (TEXT)
Yeah! What you wearing?6.7.TARA (TEXT)
I went with, ‘she’s sexy, even if 
she ain’t the smartest’.
ZIBA (TEXT)
You’re street smart, that’s better. 
Don’t forget to pack your stuff. 
I’ll bring the itineraries. 
TARA (TEXT)
You what?
ZIBA
The schedule, plan for today.
TARA (TEXT)
Yeah yeah. Can’t find my bikini so 
I’m swimmin’ in my knickers.
ZIBA
Sexy but not smart, got it!
Ziba rises to her feet, throws her phone onto her bed, 
wobbles her knees strangely, and walks across the room, 
turning up the dial to her stereo as she does so, nearly 
knocking over her telescope as she yanks open her curtains. 
She gazes at the sun-soaked view of the wide residential 
street. 
INT. ZIBA’S HOUSE, BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 10 10
Ziba brushes her teeth, while watching a YouTube live video 
of Neil DeGrasse Tyson. 
NEIL
This cluster of asteroids, which we 
call a Perseid Shower, is likely to 
be fragments of planets that tried 
to form but broke off into smaller 
pieces. This particular cluster 
will, in just over 12 hours time, 
be the closest its been to the 
earth in over 45 years. So if you 
can, wherever you live, try to 
watch this Perseid shower from 
somewhere high up. That’s where 
you’ll most likely have the best 
view- 
CUT TO:7.8.INT. ZIBA’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 11 11
Ziba shakes out her hair and pulls on her clothes: a 
patterned skirt, a cropped white vest underneath a vintage 
short sleeve shirt and white trainers. While stood in front 
of a long mirror, she fastens a gold necklace with her name 
inscribed in Farsi. 
MONA (SUBTITLED) (O.S)
Zibi, I’ve made you a 
smoothie.MONA (SUBTITLED) (O.S)
Zibi Joon, beedaary?
Ziba, using rubbing alcohol/adhesive cleaner, manages to 
perfectly unpeal the stickers on her laptop.
Meanwhile the fourth copy of an itinerary feeds out of an old 
printer. 
She scribbles on the last copy in sharpie, and slides the 
laptop and papers into her backpack.
She crosses off the last handwritten items from her notepad:
Chewing gum.
Swimsuit.
Hairbrush.
Deodorant.
Cereal bar.
Condom.
A bottle of water. 
Whiskey
3 x copies of itinerary.
1 x copy of itinerary marked ZIBA 
Laptop.
Ziba pauses, mentally checks she has everything. Then goes to 
leave. 
08:188.9.INT. ZIBA’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MORNING 12 12
Ziba sits adjacently to her mother MONA SOOFI, 42, Iranian, 
neatly dressed at a table in a modern kitchen. BBC Persia 
plays faintly in the background as Ziba streams an episode of 
“The Universe” on her phone as she fills a cereal bowl with 
Weetos. 
Mona, while reading an Iranian newspaper, bites into a piece 
of toast and soft cheese, washing it down with a miniature 
cup of Persian tea. Mona watches Ziba from over her 
newspaper.
Ziba pours cereal into a bowl. There’s slightly too much in 
there, so she takes a small handful out and puts it back in 
the packet. They speak in Farsi.

Mona looks across the table to notice that Ziba’s glass of 
red juice is untouched.

now.ZIBA (SUBTITLE)(CONT'D)
Chera nah?*
Mona ignores her.
ZIBA(CONT'D)

Don’t you dare use that tone 
with me. I will ground you 
for the rest of the summer.

A beat - Ziba goes to talk back, but stops. We move close on 
her eyes, and see a flash of emotion, before... 
FLASH TO:
EXT. WESTMINSTER BRIDGE - NIGHT 13 13
Ziba strolls along the deserted bridge, the empty whiskey 
miniature falls from her hand and onto the floor. Ziba wipes 
her mouth with her sleeve, and lifts her legs over the 
handlebars. She spins her body, her legs dangling over the 
Thames. The wind picks up her hair as she closes her eyes.

Ziba’s eyes remain on the screen.
Mona picks up her phone, turns off the screen and places it 
face down on the table.
MONA (SUBTITLE)(CONT'D)

MONA (SUBTITLE)(CONT'D)

hasn’t spoken to you. Even 
with everything that’s

Aab meeveto bekhor diggeh!*
ZIBA
WHAT’S THE FUCKING POINT? 
Mona’s shocked reaction says it all. This might be the first 
time Ziba has exploded like this. 
Mona begins to tear-up. 
She gets up, takes her plate and walks over to the sink, with 
her back turned to Ziba. She throws the plate into the sink 
and turns on the tap.
ZIBA (CONT'D)
Sorry. 
Mona remains stood, whimpering - still with her back to Ziba.
ZIBA (SUBTITLE)(CONT'D)
Mummy. 
Nothing.12.13.ZIBA(CONT'D)
Mummy, I’ll drink the juice.ZIBA (SUBTITLE)(CONT'D)
Mummy. juico meekhoram. *
Mona half turns around as Ziba picks up the glass of red 
juice and downs it in one, leaving a burgundy moustache of 
residue on her upper lip. She slams the glass on the table as 
if she’s taken a shot of tequila.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
Look!
More composed now, Mona turns off the tap and turns around. 
ZIBA (SUBTITLE)(CONT'D)
See. Delicious! Thank you 
Mummy. What was in it again?ZIBA (SUBTITLE)(CONT'D)

ZIBA (SUBTITLE)
We leave in 5.
INT./EXT. MONA SOOFI’S AUDI SALOON - MORNING [DRIVING] 15 15
Mona drives. They sit in silence, to the low hum of Classic 
FM.
ZIBA
It’s baking today.
Ziba leans on the headrest and observes a variety of details.
SERIES OF SHOTS
1) A father with his son perched on his shoulders strolling 
down a residential street.
2) A middle-aged woman smoking a cigarette on her balcony.
3) A middle-eastern man washing the windscreen off his ice-
cream van with a bucket and a sponge.13.14.Mona receives a call, she accepts through the car’s bluetooth 
system. 
MONA
Allo?
DR. GILANI (O.S.)
Miss Soofi?
MONA
Yes?
DR. GILANI (O.S.)
It’s Dr. Gilani. Are you with Ziba?
MONA
Hi doctor, yes you’re on the loud 
speaker. Ziba is here.
DR. GILANI (O.S.)
Hi Ziba, how are you?
ZIBA
Okay today, thanks.
DR. GILANI
Good, good. (A beat) Mona, I need 
you and Ziba to come in again.
Ziba taps her mother on the arm.
ZIBA 
(Whispering)
Not today. You promised.
MONA
Doctor, is it possible that we come 
tomorr-
ZIBA
(Interrupting)
It’s A-level results day. We’re on 
our way to school.
DR. GILANI
Ah! Okay. (A beat) But I still need 
you to come in Ziba, can you come  
afterwards?
Something in Ziba’s eyes again. The sound begins to muffle.
CUT TO:14.15.EXT. WESTMINSTER BRIDGE - NIGHT 16 16
Ziba, perched on the railings of the bridge.  A flashlight 
appears on her face and she loses her balance.

It’s just that - I’d rather not be 
doing this on the phone but it

now) Will you just let me have one

this? One day.

and pulls onto the side of the road.
MONA (SUBTITLE)(CONT'D)
You sure I can’t come in?MONA (SUBTITLE)(CONT'D)

Ziba smiles, leans over to her mother, and kisses her cheek, 
taking in her scent.
ZIBA
Love you mama. (In Farsi) 
Thank you for everything.ZIBA
Love you mama. (In Farsi) 
Merci barreh hamechise.*
Ziba jumps out and crosses the road. Mona watches her go, 
confused, like her baby’s now impossible to reach.   
CUT TO:
EXT. CHISWICK SCHOOL - MORNING 18 18
Sixth form students mill around waiting for their results, a 
hum of excitement in the air. 
Ziba bounds towards the building and sees SHEA PRICE, 18, 
white, stocky frame, hair gelled back with far too much 
product, and PETER CURTIS aka MERF, mixed race, half Irish, 
half Jamaican, gangly and freckled with striking features, 
messing around together.
SHEA
Zibaaaaaaaaaa.
MERF
Where the fuck have you been all 
summer?17.18.ZIBA
Missed you too. (To Shea) The one 
day you get to walk into school 
without uniform and you come 
dressed like a chav.
SHEA
What about you? Fuckin’ hipster 
wannabee.
MERF
Good one Brains. You ready? 
ZIBA
As I’ll ever be. Where’s Tara? 
SHEA
Late. As usual.
ZIBA
At least she’s consistent.
MERF
Shall we wait for her?
ZIBA
(Checks her watch) Give her three 
minutes. 
09.27
SHEA
Taz says you’ve got a little plan 
for us today yeah?
Ziba goes into her bag and pulls out the itinerary copies.
ZIBA
Here.
SHEA
Know this, I’m only here for you 
Zib, otherwise I would’ve swerved 
this. Neither of my brothers even 
came to school for results day. 
ZIBA
(Nonchalant)
Wow, I’m flattered Shea.
Shea scans the itinerary.
SHEA
20.11 asteroid shower. A lightshow?18.(MORE)19.ZIBA
It’s not a lightshow. It’s a 
celestial event.
MERF
(mimicking her)
Celestial event...
Shea laughs.
ZIBA
You can take photos and put it on 
instagram. The girls will love it.
SHEA
Alright sold. Is it to do with UFOs 
and shit?
ZIBA
Are you joking?
SHEA
Nah I dunno, I think it’s a bit 
arrogant to assume we’re the only 
living beings in the universe.
Ziba thinks on this - he’s not wrong.
MERF
I think if an alien met me they’d 
actually think - alright, respect. 
He’s alright you know?
Shea laughs. 
SHEA
Nah mate, not a chance. You’d be 
alien dinner. 
ZIBA
You know a UFO is an unidentified 
flying object. You don’t know what 
it is, that’s the point, so you 
can’t say it’s an alien. Different 
things.
SHEA
Professor Zib over here.
ZIBA
Tonight the asteroirds will be the 
closest they’ve been to the earth 
for over forty years. 
(MORE)19.ZIBA (CONT'D)20.We can’t miss it, so we have to 
stick to the schedule. 
MERF
(Looking at the itinerary)
I’ve got an audition later so you 
need to factor that into your lil 
plan alright?
SHEA
Audition? 
MERF
Girl stopped me on the street, took 
my insta, and DM’d me about a 
modelling gig. Told you I got 
somethin’ special going on with 
these cheekbones.
Ziba hits Merf in the arm, impressed, playful.
MERF(CONT'D)
It’s probably nothin’ but ya know. 
Money. If I get it.
ZIBA
Where is it?
MERF
Central. Eleven thirty.
SHEA
Turning into a fuckin’ tour of 
London. We should be on an open top 
bus. 
ZIBA
Fine. (To Shea) Is your Dad’s car 
here?
SHEA
It’s my car now, and yeah. His 
audition is congestion zone though.
Out of nowhere, TARA 17, caucasian, working class, hair 
scraped back into a pony tail, jumps onto Ziba’s back, nearly 
knocking her over. The clock on the screen having three 
seconds to spare.
09.29/09.30
TARA
We’ll split it. ZIBA (CONT'D)20.21.ZIBA
Where did you come from, you mad 
woman?
SHEA
You three split it. I already paid 
for petrol.
MERF
You are so fuckin tight, ya know 
that?
TARA
Thought you were working at your 
old man’s garage.
SHEA
I ain’t started yet -
I’m gonna be Price & Co’s most 
skilled mechanic - exhausts, 
filters, body work, you name it - 
MERF
Bet your mum and Dad are well 
proud.
SHEA
At least I got a job.
ZIBA
Why do you two have to be so mean 
to each other all the time? I’ll 
pay.
Ziba pulls out a pen and makes an amendment to her itinerary 
copy. She passes Tara her copy.
TARA
What are we waiting for? Can’t wait 
to be stood next to you when you 
get four A’s like a fuckin’ nerd.
Tara grabs Ziba’s arm and bounds into the building, as the 
guys follow.
INT. CHISWICK SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - LATER 19 19
Track: Gol-e-Aftabgardon by Nooshafarin
Ziba leads Tara, Shea and Merf down the corridor. Boys and 
girls gather in groups on each side, either rejoicing or 
sobbing with envelopes in hand. We scan across their animated 
expressions in slow-motion.21.22.Music interrupted by:
MERF
Shall we do it here then or go 
outside?
The four of them stand outside a classroom in the corridor, 
holding envelopes.
SHEA
Let’s do it here.
TARA
Maybe we should go outside.
ZIBA
No. Come on. Rip off the band aid.
SHEA
You fuckin yank, you.
TARA
She doesn’t even watch TV. Blue 
Planet doesn’t count.
ZIBA
Shut up. David Attenborough’s a 
national treasure and you know it.
SHEA 
Sorry, who?
ZIBA
I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear 
that Shea. Let’s do it. I’m doing 
it.
Ziba opens the envelope. Shea copies her. Then Merf and Tara 
do theirs.
They each read their pieces of paper. 
Shea’s face falls.
SHEA
Shit.
MERF
Damn. Not as bad as I thought to be 
fair.
TARA
I don’t need A-Levels anyway to be 
a dancer.22.23.They look to Ziba.
TARA(CONT'D)
Zib? 
ZIBA
Yeah. I did alright.
Tara takes the paper out of her hand and looks at it. 
TARA
Two A-Stars. Two As. You’re a 
bloody genius! 
MERF
Mate. Well done.
SHEA
Yeah congrats.
ZIBA
(unenthusiastic)
Thanks.
TARA
What’s wrong? You fucking smashed 
it!
MERF
You bummed about those A’s?
ZIBA
What? No. Just, shocked I guess.
TARA
Well we’re not. Always knew you 
were a total nerd. Only one of us 
lot who’s definitely gonna do big 
things with their life.
Tara smiles, and Ziba laughs. 
ZIBA
That’s not true. 
MERF
(to Shea)
You alright?
SHEA
Don’t need these to be a mechanic 
did I? Didn’t even tell Dad I was 
coming today.23.24.MERF
Yeah, fuck this. Pointless piece of 
paper. 
(beat)
Except yours, Zib, obviously. 
TARA
Your Mum’ll be chuffed. 
ZIBA
(Painting a smile)
Yeah. 
(beat)
I’m just gonna go to the bathroom. 
See you outside after? 
INT. CHISWICK SCHOOL, TOILETS - LATER 20 20
Ziba sits on a closed toilet lid, piece of paper in her hand. 
She folds and stuffs her A-Level certificates into her 
pocket, and pulls out her phone. She starts composing a 
message to Mona, trying to hold back the tears as she types.
ZIBA (TEXT)
Maman, we did it.
She deletes the message, tears streaming down her face. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - FLASHBACK 21 21
Ziba sits in front of an upright piano as Mona and her 
friends, converse on the sofa while drinking persian tea and 
eating sweets.
MONA (SUBTITLE)
Azizam, what are you waiting for. 
Go on then, play for us!
Mona’s friends gauk at Ziba. It’s clear from her body 
language and facial expression that this isn’t her idea. She 
turns her back to the room, bring her hands to the keys, and 
reluctantly plays.

sitting at desks, one metre apart, scribbling onto their 
worksheets. 24.25.We arrive at Ziba, in school uniform, who scribbles down the 
end of her sentence. The bell rings. She turns the pages back 
to the cover, and neatly arranges the worksheet, pen and 
other stationary onto the table.
ZIBA 
(To Herself) I did everything 
right. 
CUT TO:
INT. BEDROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK 23 23
Ziba, looking deathly pale, very sick, lies in bed, unable to 
do much else. She looks at her phone and comes across an

busstop. She turns off her screen and looks out the window.

INT. ZIBA’S HOUSE, GARAGE - NIGHT - DREAM SEQUENCE 25 25
Ziba opens the driver’s side door to her mother’s Audi saloon 
in a closed garage. She inserts and turns the ignition key. 
She closes the door and sits cross legged on the garage

She pulls out the miniature and takes a sip.

INT. ZIBA’S BATHROOM - NIGHT - DREAM SEQUENCE 26 26
Ziba sits in the bath, her mouth hovering just above the

It falls to the bathroom floor in slow motion.

Ziba stands up from the toilet cubicle and leaves. A group of 
girls chat in the corner as Ziba washes her hands in one of 
the three communal sinks. Tara hugs her from behind.
TARA
Proud of you mate.
ZIBA
Thanks. Proud of you too.
TARA
Don’t be daft. I fucked it. (Beat) 
What’s the matter? You’ve got a 
face like a smacked arse.
Ziba forces a smile.26.27.ZIBA
Yeah, just...you know, sad that 
we’ll never be here again. 
TARA
Oh, grow up you tart. I’d be 
jumping for joy if I was you.

What time is it?
She looks at her phone.

Coming up to ten fifteen.

Ziba drags Tara by the hand out of the toilets, and they race 
down the corridor.

Ziba and Tara, for the last time, sprint down the school

SHEA
So, what d’you reckon?
ZIBA
Yeah, it’s... nice?
TARA

You know, for uni. 
SHEA
Light it up then Merf.
Shea checks his rear-view mirror, notices Merf distorting his 
face, practicing his pout, using his phone camera as a 
mirror.
SHEA(CONT'D)
What the fuck are you doing?
MERF
What’s it look like? I’m 
practicing.
Merf receives a text.
MERF(CONT'D)

Alright, chill out. (A beat) We can

I’m just asking who Malcolm is.
MERF
He was in the year above us. 
Dropped out to play football. (To 
Shea) Where’s the window button?
SHEA
Roll it down Einstein. Tell Mal to 
meet us at your audition.
ZIBA
Hang on a sec. It’s supposed to be 
just the four of us today!
MERF
Yeah, and?
ZIBA
It’s just...you know. He’s not in 
our year is he? Does he have to 
come?
MERF
Calm down Zib. It’s not all about 
you.
Ziba, slightly hurt, leans back in her seat.
ZIBA
As long as we stick to the plan.
TARA
So what time is this asteroid 
thing?
ZIBA
Bottom of your itinerary. Eleven 
past eight.30.(MORE)31.Merf passes Shea the spliff.

Zib! Come on. Goodie fucking two 
shoes.
ZIBA 
I’m not fucking up my life by

She takes a moment - realises what she just said. Changes her 
tune and shuts up.
CUT TO:
EXT. TOTTENHAM COURT ROAD - AFTERNOON 35 35
The group walk down the busy street, zigzagging through 
traffic with little to no concern of cars, bikes and other 
vehicles.
TARA
That Billie gig we snuck into, I 
think I was the only one that had 
my phone in my pocket for the whole 
set. The whole point of being 
there, is to be in it, to be 
present, d’you know what I mean? 
MERF
Ya know that Kamal show I told you 
about? 
(MORE)31.MERF (CONT'D)32.There was a girl standing next to 
me who recorded the whole thing, 
from start to finish, she didn’t 
dance, she just filmed, stood there 
like a fuckin statue.
TARA
The moment you start recording, you 
may as well be watching from home. 
MERF
Exactly. I don’t get it. 
SHEA
My old man went to a Kate Bush gig, 
like 10 years ago. At Hammersmith 
Apollo. He said you had to check 
your phone in. 
MERF
They should bring that back.
TARA
You know every time I see a 
McDonald’s Zib I think of you.
(to the boys)
She does this fuckin’ hilarious 
impression of her Mum.
(to Zib)
Go on, show them.
ZIBA
It’s not that funny...
TARA
Go on. It is. (Beat) Go on! Please.
ZIBA
Alright. This is what she does when 
she talks to Taz in English:
(in a thick Iranian 
accent)
Hello Tara. I was vandering if you 
would like to go to MacDoonald? 
Salaam Peter, vould you like to go 
to Kentucky?
Tara laughs uncontrollably.
TARA
I can’t.MERF (CONT'D)32.33.ZIBA
(still with the accent)
Shea, do you want to go to 
Estarbux? Or we can go to Berrrger 
Keeng? Tara, shall we go to Subvay? 
Tara continues laughing, unable to control herself. Merf 
smiles but the girls are clearly in their own world with 
their own shared sense of humour.
SHEA
You two are mental.
Merf checks his phone, serious.
MERF
Mal’s on his way.
They arrive at the American Church. Merf looks up at the 
overbearing building, suddenly nervous.
MERF(CONT'D)
I think this is it.
Shea takes him by the shoulders and massages them.
SHEA
You’ve got this bro.
Tara gives Merf a hug.
TARA
Break a leg.
SHEA
Meet us back at the car yeah?
Merf disappears into the building with a nervous smile. Ziba 
suddenly winces, stops. Tara looks at her, concerned.
TARA 
What’s wrong?
ZIBA
Just... indigestion. 
TARA 
Let’s sit down.
They walk over to a bench and take a seat. 
ZIBA
Sorry. It’ll pass in a sec.33.34.TARA
Here.
Tara hands her a water bottle. She drinks from it.
ZIBA
Thanks. 
Tara sits down on the bench, next to Ziba.
TARA
The doctors said it was because of 
stress?
ZIBA
Yeah. 
TARA
Should be cool now that you’ve got 
your results?
They look at one another, legs next to each other, Shea on 
his phone.
ZIBA
I’m so vanilla. How come your legs 
are more tanned than mine?
TARA
St Tropez baby, St Tropez. 
Ziba takes another long gulp then hands the bottle back, 
wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.
ZIBA
I needed that. Thanks.
Ziba’s phone vibrates. It’s Mona. Ziba doesn’t take the call.
MALCOLM BERRY, 19, black, athletic, defined cheekbones, walks 
along the sun-soaked street in a Crystal Palace FC track 
suit.
Shea spots Malcolm approaching. He gets up from the bench and 
runs over to him, giving him a hug. Malcolm appears 
despondent. 
SHEA
You good? 
MALCOLM
Yeah.34.35.TARA
Sup Malcolm.
MALCOLM
Sup.
TARA
This is my bestie Ziba. Friends 
since the first day of Year two!
Ziba, shields the sun from her face with one hand - looks up 
at Malcolm, puts out her other hand - which he shakes.
MALCOLM
Malcolm.
ZIBA
Hey. 
Malcolm perches on the handrest. Ziba hones-in on his 
athletic arms.
MALCOLM
Did you drive here?
SHEA
Yeah. Jenny’s parked round the 
corner.
TARA
Jenny? 
SHEA
What, you don’t like Jenny? (To 
Malcolm) How d’you get here?
MALCOLM
Tube. It was a fucking oven on the 
Central Line.
Malcolm catches Ziba looking at him. Sits next to her. 
MALCOLM(CONT'D)
How was results day? 
ZIBA
Oh. Yeah. It was alright. 
SHEA
Just alright? (To Malcolm) She got 
straight As.
ZIBA
Shut up Shea.35.36.MALCOLM

TARA
You just come from training Mal?
MALCOLM
Yeah, erm, we had pre-season. 
So what’s the plan now? 
Ziba looks at her watch.
11.48
ZIBA
It’s nearly midday.
SHEA
I’d kill for a beer.
ZIBA
What are you an alcoholic?
SHEA
What? No. We’re probably the only 
ones from our year not drunk yet. 
TARA
He’s not wrong. 
MALCOLM
Drinks on Shea.
SHEA
I’ve got... Wait... 
Shea uses face recognition to log onto his bank app.
SHEA(CONT'D)
Five pounds thirty one in my 
account.
TARA
Don’t look at me.
ZIBA
Actually. I can help us all out a 
bit. Just for today. Got some money 
from my dad. 
TARA
Nice of him to make an appearance.
Ziba scans the street and shopfronts.36.37.SHEA
See, we all knew you had it in the 
bag.
ZIBA
Back in a minute.
Ziba grabs her bag and jogs across the street.
SHEA
Where she goin?
TARA 
(To Ziba) Wait for me!
INT. CEX ELECTRONICS - MOMENTS LATER 36 36
Ziba approaches the till where a middle aged Middle-Eastern 
man, in his 50s sips tea from a miniature cup while shouting 
orders at his staff. 
STORE CLERK BASSAM
I don’t know vyy, every time there 
is problem, you just switch off. 
eh! Anbd then you switch on. Twenty 
times I tell you!
Ziba slides her metallic laptop out from her backpack and 
lays it down on the counter. 
ZIBA
How much can I get for this? Less 
than a year old.
The store clerk approaches. He puts down his cup of tea, and 
puts on the glasses hanging around his neck. He turns the 
laptop upside down, studying the exterior, laying it back 
onto its base. He flips open the screen which comes to life, 
illuminating his face.
The RING of the door opening as Tara comes in. 
TARA
Zib, what you doin’? 
ZIBA
One sec.
STORE CLERK BASSAM
(Eyes on the screen)
I give you two fifty.37.(MORE)38.ZIBA
What? No way. It’s newer than the 
one in your window and that’s on

The store clerk takes another sip of his tea.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
How are you drinking tea? It’s like 
40 degrees in here.
STORE CLERK
(Eyes on the screen)
Three fifty.
ZIBA
It’s worth more. Is that the best 
you can do or do we need to go to 
your competition? 
TARA

Zib. Your mum’s gonna kill you. 
ZIBA
Trust me. Come on. Final offer. 
Five hundred? 
STORE CLERK BASSAM
Little girl, you are in cuckoo land 
if you tink I give you a five 
hundred.
The store clerk shakes his head and closes the laptop. Ziba 
notices a graduation photo over his shoulder.
ZIBA
Is that you?
The store clerk looks over his shoulder at the photo. 
ZIBA(CONT'D)
You graduated from Kings? I applied 
there. What did you study? 
STORE CLERK BASSAM
Computer science.
ZIBA
Oh sick! I’m studyin sciences - 
astrophysics course - at UCL.

you’ll know my laptop is in really 
good condition, 3 Ghz processor.

The clerk cracks a smile for the first time. Momentarily 
transported to that day.
STORE CLERK BASSAM
Yes they were. Ohh vy vy. It was a 
good day. (Back in the room and 
softened) Little girl, I give you 
four fifty.
ZIBA
Deal! 
TARA
Zib. 
The store clerk pulls out a wad of fifties.
ZIBA
I’ll take it in tens and twenties 
actually. 
The store clerk looks at her.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
Shukran.
The man nods his head, smiles, then counts the cash and lays 
it down on the counter. Ziba takes the pile, turns to leave.
TARA
What the fuck?
ZIBA
Just leave it, will you. Trust me.
INT. SHEA’S CAR - DAY 37 37
Shea’s driving again. Merf sits up front. Ziba and Tara sit 
in the backseat with Malcolm in the middle. Ziba counts her 
cash. Mike by Fred Again and Mike Skinner plays on the car 
stereo.
MERF
Think they liked me. Well I hope 
they did. What’s good Malcolm? 
How’s Wilfred Zaha?
Malcolm forces a smile.ZIBA (CONT'D)39.40.MALCOLM

MERF

happy. And this is my “get paid” 
face.
The girls gaggle in the back. 
SHEA
I could be a model.
MERF
Bollocks.
ZIBA
Oi, stop it!
Ziba is done counting, she hands the wad to Tara.
TARA
We’re fucking minted now mate.
MERF
Well, technically just Ziba is... 
TARA
Sharing’s caring. God Shea open a 
window will you, I’m sweating my 
tits off back here.
SHEA
I told you before, I don’t have a 
control up here to open the 
windows, you all need to roll them 
down yourselves. 
Tara rolls down her window. She looks to Ziba to roll down 
hers, but she stares blankly through the window.40.41.TARA
Zib, your window?
ZIBA
What? Oh sorry.
Ziba rolls down her window.
SHEA
Think of it like your daily 
exercise.
ZIBA
Is he calling us fat?
TARA
He’s calling us fat.
ZIBA
Cheeky, no drinks for him.
SHEA
Two can play that game, shall I 
drop you off at the station?
ZIBA
Funny.
SHEA
So where to now?
ZIBA
I gave you each an itinerary for a 
reason.

TARA
Why? We never go there.
ZIBA
I want to get something. 
SHEA
What, why?41.42.ZIBA
I want to get a sandwich.
Tara cackles.
MERF
Are you serious?
ZIBA
It’s the best sandwich I’ve ever 
had alright.
MERF
And we’ve all gotta come and have 
it with you? 
ZIBA
I’ll buy it, eat it, and then I’ll 
buy you a drink and you can shut 
the fuck up alright.
SHEA
Rudegirl, if you say so.
ZIBA
Ladbroke Grove end.
Suddenly Shea accelerates aggressively. They’re approaching 
the Westway.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
You know it’s thirty on here -
SHEA
You don’t even drive.
Shea is doing forty. 
ZIBA
Shea, slo... 
She stops herself.
SHEA
Waheeeeeey! We’ll get there before 
that sandwich sells out don’t you 
worry! 
Tara laughs, enjoying it. Merf opens a window. Malcolm looks 
a bit nervous but looks at Ziba and smiles, trying to act 
cool. After a moment sitting like this, Malcolm interjects 
the music:42.43.MALCOLM
I - I think we’re actually about to 
go past my place. By the Westway. 
Do you think we could just stop 
there for one second? I need to get 
something.
SHEA
What do you need? 
MALCOLM
Just - it’s boring really. 
SHEA
I mean - Zib?
12.42
Ziba looks pissed off, a little antsy.
ZIBA
You really need to?
MALCOLM
I’d really appreciate it, yeah.
Ziba looks at him - his eyes - he’s persuasive... 
ZIBA
Yeah. Sure. Okay.  
EXT. OUTSIDE PORTISHEAD HOUSE - DAY 38 38
Ziba climbs out of the car so that Malcolm can get out too. 
Malcolm leans down to Shea’s window.

He stands looking at Ziba for a minute. She looks at him.
ZIBA
I’ll come with.
INT. PORTISHEAD HOUSE - MALCOLM’S FLAT - DAY - CONTINUOUS 39 39
Malcolm enters, followed by Ziba, into a sparsely furnished 
living room with visible damp stains on the walls. A rusty 
old fan makes a routine noise as it moves. It’s BOILING hot. 
MIA BERRY (4), devilishly cute with her hair in two thick 
buns, dressed in pyjamas, plays with her teddy.43.44.MALCOLM
(Shouting)
Mum! Hi Mia.
TONYA BERRY (37), in dressing gown enters, with a cordless 
phone pressed to her ear.
TONYA

(to Malcolm)
You’re back early? 
(into the phone)
Yeah well if you don’t get someone 
in here tomorrow to unseal these 
windows you will be sorry. Yeah. 
You too. 
Tonya hangs up, exasperated. 
MALCOLM
Mum this is - 
ZIBA
Ziba.
Ziba holds out a formal hand. Tonya shakes it, faintly 
amused. 
MIA
Hugsies!
MALCOLM
Not right now Mia.
MIA
(Insistent)
Hugsies!
Malcolm kneels down and gives her a hug as Ziba watches.
MIA(CONT'D)
You forgot about Ted.
Malcolm pats the teddy.
MALCOLM
Sorry Ted.
Malcolm stands up.44.45.TONYA
(to Malcolm)
How was training? 
MALCOLM 
Just a half sesh today. I need to 
grab something from my room.
Malcolm paces into his room.
ZIBA
Your daughter’s really cute.
TONYA
Ah thank you. She’s a diva is what 
she is.
MALCOLM (O.S.)
Mum, can you come in here for a 
sec?
TONYA
I’ll be right back. Lovely to meet 
you, Ziba. 
Ziba scans the wall art and photographs, many of which show a 
younger Malcolm playing/winning football trophies. She 
notices a larger picture frame of a middle aged man we 
presume to be Malcolm’s father. 
Ziba watches through the crack in the door, and listens to 
what’s going on inside the bedroom. Occasionally she pulls a 
funny face or gives a smile to Mia. 
TONYA (O.S.)(CONT'D)
What is it?
MALCOLM
(He exhales)
Coach called me into his office. 
And. Well... He erm, he said...
TONYA
Not about the boots again?
MALCOLM
What? No, nothing about the boots.
TONYA
If you can hold out ‘til Christmas, 
can probably manage a new pair 
then.45.46.MALCOLM
Mum, it’s not about the boots.
A beat. Malcolm purses his lips, lowers his gaze.
MALCOLM(CONT'D)
They’re not renewing my contract. 
TONYA
What?
He pulls out the letter.
MALCOLM
Here. Coach told me to tell you to 
read this and call...
Tonya, out of nowhere, slaps Malcolm hard with her palm.
Malcolm brings a hand up to his face and looks back at her in 
shock. Tonya looks shocked too, at her own actions, can’t 
speak.
TONYA
I... I didn’t mean to do that... 
Malcolm is stunned. 
MALCOLM
It’s okay...
TONYA
I’m sorry...
Tonya slumps into Malcolm’s desk chair, unable to move or 
comfort her son. 
TONYA(CONT'D)
Ten fucking years, Malcolm. Ten 
years! Dropping you off, picking 
you up, all this money on kit... 
everything I’ve done, and your Dad 
too. 
MALCOLM
D’you think I meant for this to 
happen...? 
The door creaks open, as Malcolm leaves and notices Ziba 
watching. Tonya sits, embarrassed. 
TONYA
Where are you going? Mal? 46.47.Malcolm ignores her. He looks at Ziba. 
MALCOLM
C’mon, let’s go.
INT. WHITSTABLE HOUSE TOWER LIFT - DAY - CONTINUOUS 40 40
Malcolm stands facing the door and slightly ahead of Ziba. 
They travel down to the ground floor in silence.
Track: Central by Federico Albanese.
ZIBA
Are you okay?
A long pause.
MALCOLM
(Still facing the door)
Please don’t tell the others.
The elevator doors open, Malcolm walks out, Ziba follows.
EXT. SHEA’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 41 41
Shea is now standing outside the car, smoking the spliff that 
Ziba hid in the glove box. He passes it to Merf.
SHEA
What the fuck were you guys doing? 
Merf wolf whistles. Tara makes rude hand gestures.
MALCOLM
Sorry we took so long.
Shea goes to high-five Malcolm who swerves it with skill.
SHEA
Right, come on. Apparently we’re 
going to find a fucking sandwich. 
My days. 
EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - FALAFAL KING - LATER 42 42
Ziba exits a cafe, holding a pitta in paper wrapping. The 
group wait outside for her.47.48.TARA
(to the tune of Here Comes 
the Bride)
Da-da-da-daaaaa! Da-da-da-daaaa! 
SHEA
Behold - the sandwich of all 
sandwiches. 
MERF
The life-changing snack.
ZIBA
It is life-changing, I’m telling 
you.
MALCOLM
What’s... in it? Falafal?
SHEA
No shit Sherlock. 
ZIBA
Yes falafal. Halloumi. Pickles. 
Aubergine. And. (Takes a bite) 
Tahini!
TARA
You know you can get that on any 
high street?
ZIBA
(Full mouth) Not like this. 
Ziba closes her eyes and chews.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
This is legit the best sandwich I 
can ever remember eating.
TARA
When the fuck you been coming to 
Portobello?
ZIBA
Used to come this way every 
Saturday. With my Grandad. Been a 
few years though.
SHEA
This girl remembers a sandwich she 
ate three years ago and I can 
barely remember my own phone 
number.48.49.MERF
And that’s why she got A stars and 
you got three Es.
Shea hits Merf in the arm playfully.
MALCOLM
You’ve got some on your -
A bit of food is on Ziba’s chin and Malcolm awkwardly points 
at it- trying to help.
ZIBA
(Wiping) Cheers. 
TARA
So how is it then? 
As Tara says this she lingers on the word and looks to 
Malcolm, raising her eyebrows.
ZIBA
Orgasmic!
TARA
How would you know?
Malcolm pretends he did’t hear that.
ZIBA
(To Tara) You want some?
Ziba holds out the pitta.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
Have a bite. Go on, you won’t 
regret it.
TARA
Go on then.
Tara grabs the pitta in foil, and gets her mouth around the 
bread, taking a large bite. She chews. Her expression slowly 
changes. Still chewing, she motions for Shea to get involved. 
Shea takes the pitta, takes his bite from the side. He nods 
his head in appreciation, handing it to Merf. He takes a 
bite.
MERF
Mmm, mmm, mmm!49.50.ZIBA
Exxxxactly! What did I say? They 
don’t call it falafal king for 
nothing.
TARA
He is the king of falafel.
Merf passes the pitta back to Ziba.
ZIBA
(To Malcolm) D’you want the last 
bite?
MALCOLM
Nah, not hungry.
Suddenly everyone has stopped and is looking at Ziba. Her 
nose is bleeding. A lot.
ZIBA
What? 
A bit of blood drips onto the back of her hand.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
Shit.
She holds her hands up to her face.
TARA
Napkin.
ZIBA
Fuck.
TARA
Bathroom, come on.
Malcolm looks on concerned.
SHEA
She gets these sometimes.
MALCOLM
Yeah? 
MERF
Bit gross but nothing to worry 
about.
Ziba looks back as she and Tara run inside to find a toilet. 
Malcolm’s not convinced - Merf isn’t really convinced either. 50.51.INT. PUB TOILETS - MOMENTS LATER 43 43
Tara pulls lots of hand tissues out of the holder and hands 
them to Ziba who holds them against her nose.
ZIBA
Okay okay-
TARA
Jesus it’s like a fucking nose 
tsunami. 
ZIBA
That’s disgusting.
TARA
It’s not my nose.
Ziba tries to stifle a laugh.
ZIBA
Don’t make me laugh!
TARA
Sorry.
A beat as Ziba cleans herself up and checks her reflection.
ZIBA
So tired of this shit. I look like 
a crackhead.
Tara hands Ziba another tissue, then another. They both stand 
in silence for a moment, before:
TARA
You alright Zib? 
ZIBA
I’m fine.
TARA
Come on. 
ZIBA
Honestly it’s just a -
TARA
I mean the way you’ve been looking 
at him... and he’s been looking at 
you... 
Oh. She means Malcolm.51.52.ZIBA
Oh. Yeah. I mean, he’s fit...
TARA
Not my cup of tea but deffo your 
type. You gonna get with him? About 
time you got some action.
ZIBA
I’ve only known him a couple of 
hours.
TARA
Already met the parents...
Ziba laughs.
ZIBA
He’s got a cute little sister.
TARA
Good with kids... Good with his... 
(thinking of a joke)
balls...? 
There’s a knock at the door.
TARA(CONT'D)
Just a minute!
SHEA
It’s Shea.
TARA
Yeah?
SHEA (O.S.)
I think it’s time for these drinks 
we’ve been promised? 
ZIBA
I’m fine by the way, thanks for 
asking. Twat. 
Ziba finishes clearing her nose and throws all the tissues in 
the bin. 
ZIBA(CONT'D)
How do I look?
TARA
Like the Persian Hermione Grainger.52.53.ZIBA
I wish.
TARA
That was a dig.
SHEA (O.S.)
Erm...hello?
Ziba checks the time, and opens the door.
14:09
ZIBA
Alright, keep your gel on. Next 
stop Hampstead, we can get drinks 
on the way.
EXT. SHEA’S GOLF - AFTERNOON [DRIVING] - LATER 44 44
We fly above the white VW Golf as it travels up Harrow Road, 
and then through Camden en-route to Hampstead. 
Seasaw by Jamie XX plays in the car.
EXT. SHEA’S GOLF - AFTERNOON [DRIVING] - CONTINUOUS 45 45
Shea’s driving again. Tara, Ziba and Malcolm in the back 
seats, Merf riding shotgun.
Shea grabs the half smoked spliff from the ashtray and shares 
it with Tara. Ziba lets it slide this time.
SHEA
Here Taz.
MERF
Oi, don’t leave me out.
Showing off, out of character:
ZIBA
Or me.
Ziba reaches, and takes a drag. The others look at her like - 
what the fuck? 
She coughs. Offers it to Malcolm. He passes. She looks 
embarrassed.
MALCOLM
I’m good. Thanks though.53.54.Merf takes the spliff, giving Ziba a suspicious look as he 
does so. 
MALCOLM(CONT'D)
Where we going?
ZIBA
Hampstead Heath. Here, you can have 
my itinerary. I packed a spare.
Ziba hands the paper to Malcolm.
MALCOLM
Lived in this city my whole life 
and never been to Hampstead Heath.
Malcolm scans the schedule.
SHOT: Panning down the order of events on Tara’s itinerary: 
09.30 @ School. 
Merf’s audition W1 (scribbled in pen)
Falafel King
Hampstead Heath
Last Swim
Alexandra Palace Park
Perseid Shower
11.59 - 
MALCOLM(CONT'D)
What happens at 11.59?
MERF
What d’you mean?
MALCOLM
At the bottom of the schedule.
Merf looks at his copy.
MERF
Mine doesn’t have that.
TARA
Mine neither.54.55.ZIBA
Wait what? Oh, that’s just the last 
train.
Malcolm nods.
MALCOLM
Okay.
Ziba changes the subject.
ZIBA
Shea, can you turn it up?
Shea turns up the music.
Malcolm and Ziba’s knees kiss as they travel through Central 
London, Malcolm shyly moving away as he looks out through the 
window. 
INT. OFF-LICENSE - AFTERNOON - LATER 46 46
Ziba and Tara burst into an off-license and fill a basket 
with crisps, dip, cans of beer and pre-mixed cans of gin and 
tonic. 
Shea and Merf buy tobacco and make small talk with the store 
clerk. 
Ziba opens the fridge door and lets the cool mist run across 
her face and skin. Malcolm watches from further down the 
aisle, and when Ziba notices, he grabs the first drink in 
view, a choco milk.
Ziba goes to the till to pay for everything. 
EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH PONDS - AFTERNOON 47 47
The group sunbathe on a grassy patch by the lake.
SHOT: Top-shot medium of their five faces as they look up at 
the sky as Ziba points their attention to a specific cloud.
ZIBA
See how it’s shaped like a fluffy 
cauliflower? These are the types of 
clouds we normally get in England 
during summer. Cumulus clouds.
MERF
That one looks like a feather.55.56.TARA
That one looks like a heart. 
ZIBA
That one looks like a sea horse. Do 
you see it?
TARA
That one looks like a puppy.
SHEA
That one looks like a dildo.
TARA
You mean like your dick? Short and 
tiny. 
SHEA
Fuck off. 
ZIBA
You wanna know something weird?
SHEA
Here we go.
ZIBA
If the sun died right now, we 
wouldn’t know about it for eight 
minutes. 
MALCOLM
What?
ZIBA
That’s how long it takes for the 
light to reach Earth, so if it 
stopped, we’d just be sitting here 
and wouldn’t know til then.
TARA
So we’re basically looking back in 
time.
Malcolm sits up.
ZIBA
Something like that
SHEA
(putting on a silly voice)
Woaaaaah. Deep. 56.57.TARA
How many minutes? 
ZIBA
Eight. 
TARA
Before complete darkness? 
ZIBA
Yeah. What would you do?
TARA
If I had eight minutes?
MERF
Drop a pill. Go raving.
ZIBA
All of that in eight minutes?
SHEA
I’d fuck someone’s brains out.
MERF
You mean lose your virginity?
TARA
Wheeeey.
SHEA
Funny guy.
MALCOLM
I think I’d probably just lie down, 
close my eyes, and try n’remember 
all the best things that ever 
happened to me.
A beat. 
TARA
Shit man. I’d probably just call my 
Nanna and tell her I love her.
ZIBA
That’s sweet.
Suddenly a vibration. Ziba looks down to her phone. Her mum 
calling. She ignores it. 
Ziba stands-up and kicks out her legs. She fixates on the 
pond. 57.58.She kicks off her shoes and strips down to her vest and 
bikini bottom. She turns, runs and dives headlong into the 
lake. 
The bright sun glints onto the water before Ziba’s head comes 
into frame. We are back with her adult self. She pants, 
shocked by the cold water but energized and alive. The group 
get to their feet. 
ZIBA(CONT'D)
C’MON THEN! Water’s nice n’ cool.
Malcolm, encouraged by Ziba’s spontaneity, strips down to his 
boxers and jumps-in too. One by one, the others follow, 
diving into the lake with the excitement of young children. 
TARA
Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Malcolm laughs.
MALCOLM
Swim! It’ll warm you up. 
TARA
No thanks.
Malcolm heads out into the pond; Ziba follows, shivering, but 
smiling, the thrill of the cold meaning she thinks of nothing 
else - perhaps for the first time in a long time.
Shea and Merf are also in the water, messing about, being 
silly. 
ZIBA
I’ve drunk too much for this.
MALCOLM
How much did you have? Like half a 
can?
ZIBA
Lightweight. Guilty. 
MALCOLM
Me too, don’t tell Merf. 
Ziba laughs. They swim up to the edge of the swimming area, 
and lean on the floats and the cord connecting them.
MALCOLM(CONT'D)
I should bring my little sis here. 
She’d love it.58.59.A long beat.
ZIBA
What are you going to do?
Malcolm looks across, he knows what she’s referencing.
MALCOLM
No point getting upset over 
something you can’t change. (Beat)
I’ll go on some trials. (Beat) 
Maybe I’ll just pack it in. 
ZIBA
You’d really quit football?
MALCOLM
Maybe. (Beat) Do something else. 
What’s your plan? 
CUT TO:
EXT. WESTMINSTER BRIDGE - NIGHT 48 48
Ziba stands on the side of the bridge, empty whiskey bottle 
in hand, looking down at the Thames. 
CUT BACK TO:
EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH PONDS - DAY 49 49
ZIBA
Got a place at university. 
MALCOLM
Which one?
ZIBA
UCL.
MALCOLM
Wow. Smart. 
ZIBA
Not really.
MALCOLM
Merf said you’re the cleverest girl 
in school.
ZIBA
You mean he said I’m a nerd.59.60.MALCOLM
Nah nah, very complimentary I 
promise.
They laugh. 
MALCOLM(CONT'D)
What you studying?
ZIBA
Astrophysics. 
MALCOLM
Stars n’ shit.
ZIBA
(She laughs)
Yeah, I guess so.
MALCOLM
I kind of wish I worked a bit 
harder now, but... Hey. If you’re 
going to uni... how come you sold 
your laptop? 
ZIBA
Tara can’t keep her mouth shut can 
she?
Ziba thinks about replying further, but isn’t sure what to 
say. 
MERF
Zib! Aren’t we meant to be going to 
the next place yet? Can’t believe 
I’m the only one checking the time.
16:10
ZIBA
Alright smart arse.
MALCOLM
Race back to the edge? One breath. 
Underwater.
SHEA
Whoever comes last buys the next 
round.  
ZIBA
Alright. On my count. No cheating. 
I’m looking at you Shea. Three. 
Two.60.61.Ziba swims away. 
Track: Ziba’s Theme by Federico Albanese
MALCOLM
Chief!
Under the surface, they begins to swim fast. Shea and Merf 
glide past Ziba. Malcolm hangs back, he lets Ziba stay ahead. 
Tara watches from the side.
TARA
C’mon Zib, you got this!
Ziba glides through the water. But can’t keep up. She comes 
up for air. As she breaks the surface, she notices that she 
is alone in the midst of the pond. Ziba hears the encouraging 
yet incomprehensible words of Mona. She scans the landscape 
for her. 
MONA (SUBTITLE) (O.S)
Zibaaaaa. Jigaram.MONA (O.S)
Zibaaaaa. My heart.
She is her younger self. Young Ziba (4) looks up, takes a 
deep breath and then goes back under. 
SHOT: Bird’s eye view of Young Ziba swimming breast-stroke in 
the pond.
We go back under the surface with Ziba (18) mid race.
Shea jumps out the water first followed by Merf. One by one 
pulling themselves out of the water. Malcolm overtakes Ziba 
and arrives next, pulling himself up and out.
Ziba arrives last, and comes up for air. Panting, Ziba goes 
to lift herself out but struggles to get her body up and 
over.
She tries once more, almost succeeding in getting one leg up 
and out of the water, but doesn’t quite make it and falls 
back into the water.
Malcolm notices Ziba struggling. He walks over, leans down, 
offering her his hand. Ziba looks up, half-embarrassed half-
relieved. Malcolm lifts her out. 
MALCOLM
You okay?
ZIBA
Just a bit tipsy.61.62.SHEA
Come on then. Parking’s gonna run 
out.
EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - LATER 50 50
The group, still wet but now dressed, drag their stuff back 
through the park towards the car.
They see an ICE CREAM VAN and Tara makes a beeline.
Ziba gets out some cash and Shea suddenly swipes a couple of 
notes from her.
Merf and Tara go over to the van and make their orders.
The following conversation plays out over imagery of the 
group strolling through the park while eating ice-cream.
ZIBA (O.S.)
So what club do you play for again?
MALCOLM (O.S.)
Crystal Palace. Under 23s. 
ZIBA (O.S.)
Striker?
MALCOLM (O.S.)
Right wing. You know any 
footballers Zeeb?
ZIBA (O.S.)
That’s so sexist. Eric Cantona. 
Frank Lampard. David Beckham. Ali 
Daie.
MALCOLM (O.S.)
I’m impressed.
ZIBA (O.S.)
I’m a United fan.
MALCOLM (O.S.)
Yeah?
SHEA (O.S.)
Pssst.
ZIBA (O.S.)
My Grandad was, so I was.62.63.MALCOLM (O.S.)
Your Grandad’s from Manchester?
ZIBA (O.S.)
My Grandad’s from Tehran.
MALCOLM (O.S.)
Oh.
SHEA (O.S.)
She’s Iranian innit? Only talks 
about it about seventy times a day.
MALCOLM (O.S.)
You ever been? 
ZIBA (O.S.)
Iran? Not for a few years. Would 
love to go again. But it’s messed 
up there right now.
MALCOLM (O.S.)
You speak Iranian?
ZIBA (O.S.)
Farsi, yeah. Bit rusty though. 
Tara and Merf arrive back with more drinks and hand them out.
TARA
Here’s the change.
MERF
Cheers Zeeb.
SHEA
Yeah cheers. Zeeb?
Ziba, now off the path and on the grass is still glaring at 
the horizon. 
TARA
Earth to Ziba.
ZIBA
Sorry, was just...doesn’t matter.
Malcolm hands the last drink from the bag to Ziba.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
I’m okay. You have it.
She smiles back at him.63.64.EXT. NASSINGTON ROAD - DAY - AFTERNOON - MOMENTS LATER 51 51
The crew arrive at a residential cul-de-sac where Shea’s car 
is parked. Shea opens the boot, takes off his t-shirt and 
throws on a fresh white tee. 
SHEA
Girls, dash your stuff in the boot.
TARA
You’re not driving are you?
SHEA
Yeah. Why?
TARA
You’ve had four beers.
MERF
Five beers.
SHEA
Fuck off Merf. Honestly, I’m fine. 
Look! 
He walks toward Tara, arms stretched out, one foot directly 
in front of the next, to convey his sobriety.
TARA
What time is this thing?
Ziba looks at her watch. 
16:11
ZIBA
Elevent past eight. We’ve got ages. 
TARA
We can get bikes.
SHEA
Seriously, I’m cool to drive. (A 
beat) You lot cycle. I’ll meet you 
there.
MALCOLM
We’ll come back for your car later.
Shea remains still. Determined. Deep down he knows they’re 
right.
SHEA
Alright. For fuck’s sake.64.65.Shea slams the boot shut. He walks away from the car and back 
up the street.
SHEA(CONT'D)
C’mon then, it’s this way!
EXT. BISHOPS AVENUE - AFTERNOON 52 52
The gang all have Boris Bikes now. The boys cycle as a pack, 
up ahead, the girls lagging behind.
SHEA
You never approach a girl from 
behind, always from an angle. 
Ideally 45 degrees. So they can see 
you in their peripheral vision.
MERF
Oh right, gimme a sec while I get 
my compass out.
SHEA
Also you only have a nine second 
window to speak to a girl once 
you’ve made eye contact. You gotta 
strike then and there. Otherwise 
the moment is gone and you never 
get it back. Trust me. 
MALCOLM
Like taking a shot at the goal. The 
best ones you just hit it, without 
really thinking. See a moment, take 
it. If you think about it too much 
you scuff it. 
SHEA
See? He gets it. 
Merf and Malcolm begin to take turns cycling without hands.
MERF
No hands. 
MALCOLM
No hands! 
SHEA
Show offs.
MERF
Go on then, let’s see you.65.66.SHEA
Fine.
Shea, for a split-second, blink and you miss it, takes his 
hands off the handle bars before putting them firmly back on.
MERF
What the fuck was that? Barely a 
second.
Merf laughs.
SHEA
Still did it.
MALCOLM
Look at the size of these houses.
MERF
They’re fucking massive.
SHEA
Bishop’s Avenue. Most of them are 
empty too. Russian and Chinese 
billionaires. Apparently ASAP 
stayed here once.
MALCOLM
You could throw a sick party in one 
of these.
MERF
Maybe you can buy one one day with 
that footballer money.
SHEA
How much do they pay you these 
days? 
Malcolm suddenly looks pissed off, upset but trying to hide 
it - he didn’t want another reminder of this morning’s news.
MALCOLM
I’d get paid more to work in 
Starbucks I reckon.
SHEA
Give it a few years. You’ll be 
rolling in it.
The boys cycle in silence for a moment before.66.67.MALCOLM
(looking back at the 
girls)
What’s the galdem saying? 
MERF
Ziba?
MALCOLM
Yeah.
MERF
No. 
MALCOLM
No what? 
MERF
No. She doesn’t have a boyfriend.
Malcolm smiles.
SHEA
Never has. 
Ziba and Tara cycling behind, Ziba struggling to keep up.
TARA
Once he’s had enough drinks he’ll 
slowly - SLOWLY - make his way over 
to me and grind on me. From behind. 
No words.
ZIBA
Why doesn’t he just talk to you?
(out of breath)
Like a normal person? 
TARA
If you know any normal boys please 
send them my way.
(beat)
I mean Malcolm seems normal...
ZIBA
Stop it.
Malcolm glances back at Ziba briefly, and Tara notices.
TARA
He liiiiikes you.
Suddenly Ziba really slows down. 67.(MORE)68.TARA(CONT'D)
You alright mate? 
ZIBA
Yeah. Yeah. 
She takes a moment to almost stop, then picks up the speed 
again.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
So he has a girlfriend? 
TARA
Knew it. No. I asked Merf in the 
car.
ZIBA
Course you did.
TARA
You’d be a great WAG.
ZIBA
Can you imagine? My mum would love 
that. 
Ziba is out of breath again.
Suddenly, the world swirls and Ziba falls to the ground.
The screen goes black. 
A strange noise whirrs in the background as Tara’s concerned 
voice fades out.
Footsteps in an echoey corridor.
FLASHBACK TO:
INT. DR GILANI’S OFFICE - SAME 53 53
We’re close on Ziba’s face, a long zoom, slowly moving in 
towards her as her face reacts to what she’s hearing. She 
hears herself speaking, but we don’t see her speak. 
DR GILANI (O.S.)
There’s an abundance of white blood 
cells called leukemic blasts, they 
populate the bone marrow, and 
interfere with your body’s 
production of other types of cells 
in your bloodstream, namely red 
blood cells. 
(MORE)68.DR GILANI (O.S.) (CONT'D)
(MORE)69.This explains your chronic nose-
bleeds, the bouts of exhaustion, 
and the pain in your joints. I’ve 
referred you to the teenage ward at 
the Royal Marsden. Beginning on 
Friday, Ziba will need to attend 
daily - 
ZIBA (O.S.)
For how long? I start university in 
September.
MONA (O.S.)
She has unconditional offer -
DR GILANI (O.S.)
Ten weeks, followed by a short 
break, then perhaps a slightly 
shorter course. Five months and 
then we’ll reassess. It might be 
wise if you defer. I can ask the 
registrar to write a letter that

Ziba? Ziba are you okay?
CUT BACK TO:
EXT. NORTH END WAY - AFTERNOON 54 54
Ziba is lying on the side of the road, her friends crowded 
around her.
TARA
Zib? Jesus you gave us a right 
fright.
ZIBA
Where am I?
SHEA
You fell off your bike.
MERF
Have you got her Mum’s number? 
TARA
Yeah.
ZIBA
No! No. Probs just my blood 
pressure.
TARA
Maybe eat something?
SHEA
We went all the way to Notting Hill 
for a fucking sandwich -
TARA
Shea!
Tara gives Shea a look. He shuts up.DR GILANI (O.S.) (CONT'D)70.71.ZIBA
Some sugar maybe? 
Ziba begins to sit up. She takes it slowly, Tara helping her 
arm. She touches the right side of her face.
MALCOLM
You’ve scratched your face.
Ziba stands. Takes a few steps. And then sits down on the 
curb. 
TARA
I’ve got some smarties in my bag. 
Here. Stole ‘em from Mrs Rogers. 
Ziba takes out her phone and checks her face. She runs her 
hand over her scratched cheek.
TARA(CONT'D)
Here.
Tara hands the chocolate to Ziba.
ZIBA
Thanks. 
TARA
Shall I call Mona then?
ZIBA
She’ll only worry.
TARA
Maybe she should worry? You just 
hit your head on the fucking 
concrete. 
ZIBA
I’m fine. Seriously. 
TARA
Zib - I’m not trying to act like 
your mother or whatever but - come 
on, you should lie down. We can do 
this another day. 
Ziba notices Merf speaking quietly to Shea, off to the side.
MERF
Bro, she hit her head on the 
fuckin’ concrete. 71.72.SHEA
I can cycle her back? Or we can get 
a cab? 
Merf notices Ziba watching her.
MALCOLM
I know I’m the newbie here but 
maybe we call it. You’ve hurt 
yourself - 
ZIBA
If you want to call it a day then 
fine. But we’re not. You’ve already 
slowed down our plans.
Ouch. A beat. 
ZIBA(CONT'D)
Let’s just stick to the plan.
TARA
Babe. 
ZIBA
I told you I’m fine, and I told you 
we are going to finish this day! 
A beat. Awkward silence.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
It’s a tiny scratch, that’s all.
TARA
We can do something tomorrow. Or 
the day after.
ZIBA
The asteroid shower only happens 
once every forty fucking years. So 
no, we can’t do it tomorrow, can we 
ya dumb cow?
Nobody says anything. Malcolm looks at his feet.
17.04
SHEA
I guess we’ll just coch here then.72.Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy) 73.EXT. HAMPSTEAD PERGOLA - DAY - LATER 55 55
The group sit in silence, spread out across the outdoor 
structure, their bikes parked along the pillared walkway. 
Ziba sits on a bench, holding a tissue against her bruised 
cheek. The silence is eventually broken by:
MERF
I need a piss.
MALCOLM
I’ll come with you.
TARA
Me too. Zib?
She doesn’t answer.
SHEA
I’ll hang here.
Tara, Malcolm and Merf stroll down the walkway. Ziba rummages 
through her bag for her phone. She notices seven missed calls 
from Mona. She hits dial and bring her phone up to her ear.
ZIBA
Maman?
We can faintly hear Mona’s animated voice.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
I know, I’m sorry.
Ziba notices Shea rummaging around in his short pockets. She 
switches to Farsi.
ZIBA (SUBTITLE)(CONT'D)
I lost track of time. I’m sorry. 
Somewhere in Hampstead. Ba *

We cut back and forth between Ziba at the pergola, and Mona, 
seated at a table in her kitchen, playing rummy with four

An explosion of laughter and noise comes through the phone.

Merci khale.
INT. ZIBA’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - SAME 58 58
The atmosphere is joyous and celebratory at Ziba’s home, with 
improvised dialogue over Iranian music. 
EXT. HAMPSTEAD PERGOLA - SAME 59 59
Muffled noise comes through the phone.
ZIBA
I can’t hear you. It’s breaking up. 
I’ll call you later.
She hangs up. And looks across at Shea, who unwraps a 
chocolate wrapper with a mushroom logo - he puts a piece into 
his mouth.
SHEA
What? Was gonna wait for the light 
show. But fuck it.
Ziba looks out across the garden, and then back at Shea.
ZIBA
Can I have one?74.75.SHEA
(laughing)
What?
ZIBA
Can I have one?
SHEA
You ever done one of these before? 
It’s shrooms.
ZIBA
No but - I just fancy it.
Shea looks for the others.
SHEA
Errr, maybe let’s wait for Taz.
Ziba stares him down.
SHEA(CONT'D)
You ain’t ready for this. It’s no 
joke.
ZIBA
Why do you lot always treat me like 
a fuckin child? I’m sick of it.
SHEA
You being serious right now? 
Ziba ignores him, looks back out over the vista.
SHEA(CONT'D)
Okay. Suit yourself. But hear me 
now, if you have a bad trip, that’s 
on you.
ZIBA
I won’t have a bad trip.
SHEA
(Imitating her) I won’t have a bad 
trip. Had a couple drags of a 
spliff and is suddenly Class As 
expert.
Ziba can’t help but laugh.
ZIBA
Shut up!75.76.Ziba gets up, and walks over to Shea, sitting down next to 
him. Shea breaks off a piece, and hands it to her.
SHEA
Have a half. Make sure you chew. 
And try not to...
Before he’s finished his sentence, Ziba has already puts the 
whole piece in her mouth.
ZIBA
Thanks. 
SHEA
Alright then. Hold onto your hat 
yeah?
Shea looks at his phone for the time.
SHEA(CONT'D)
How long are we here for again?
17.43
ZIBA
Who cares?
Ziba lies down on the grass. Shea looks nervous, he hasn’t 
seen Ziba this carefree - is she gonna be okay?
Ziba turns her head, low in the grass, she sees Tara, Merf 
and Malcolm coming back up the path. She rests her eyes.
Ziba comes around. The pergola structure begins to move, the 
mushroom cholocate taking effect. Tara has taken some too, 
and Merf. Malcolm hasn’t, but watches intently.
Ziba, receives a video message from Mona, while her guests 
sing a Persian folk song in the background. The phone gets 
passed around, as they each share a congratulatory message in 
Farsi. 
TARA
I’m coming up nicely. 
ZIBA
Wavey. There’s like...levels. 
SHEA
Zib 2.0! 
MERF
I like this side of her.76.77.TARA
I like every side of her.
Tara hugs Ziba tight and Ziba smiles, hugging her back, 
pausing the video message. Her pupils noticeably dilated, she 
looks around.
ZIBA
Everything looks so...green, no 
blue, wait, it’s definitely 
green...I don’t know.
TARA
I see colour, even when I close my 
eyes.
Ziba cracks up, and goes back to her phone, resuming the 
video message from Mona. The music comes through. Ziba lies 
down, closes her eyes, and smiles. That “first trip” kind of 
smile. She sinks into the ground, slowly absorbed into the 
grass.
Music starts: Gole Yagh by Kourosh Yaghmaei.
EXT. GARDEN - DAY 60 60
Ziba (4) runs rings around Majid who is holding a bubble 
wand. Bubbles float through the air and she laughs 
hysterically as she pops them. Majid tickles her and they 
embrace, falling to the floor, cheeks side-to-side. 
EXT. HOLIDAY POOL - DAY 61 61
A YOUNG ZIBA (6) swims. She’s on holiday. Her Dad, MAJID (31) 
watches on and smiles at her. She smiles back then dips her 
head under the water.
EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT 62 62
Ziba (7) is playing in a garden in the dark, fireworks go off 
overhead. Along with a group of other kids, she jumps over a 
miniature bonfire, brave, enjoying herself. 
EXT. THEME PARK - DAY 63 63
Ziba (9) sits up-front on a log flume with her Mother seated 
behind her. The log slowly travels-up a steep incline.77.78.SHOT: Ziba’s animated face as the log comes hurtling down. 
Her hair flies in the wind as water is thrust upon her 
thrilled face.
EXT. CLIFFS - DAY 64 64
Ziba (16) is being led by an olive-skinned Portuguese boy to 
the diving-point of an ocean-facing cliff. He tries to pull 
her to the edge but she breaks from him. He senses her 
apprehension. He takes a breath. And jumps off. He lands feet-
first. We see it all from Ziba’s perspective. As he surfaces 
and smiles, he shouts in delight.
LEO
Whoo, vamos Ziba! C’mon!
ZIBA
(To herself) Okay.
She steps back from the edge to give herself a run up. She 
takes a deep breath and launches herself off the cliff-edge. 
She jumps into the bright blue ocean, bringing her feet 
together as she makes contact with the water. She comes up to 
the surface drawing a large breath as she does so.
EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH PONDS - DAY 65 65
Ziba (18) sits in a circle amongst her friends. We know the 
scene, except we watch it play out from above. 
Ziba stands and fixates on the large body of water. She 
slides down her skirt and removes her shirt. She launches 
herself at the lake and dives head first into the glistening 
water. She comes-up for breath. But rather than break the 
surface, she rises back up through the grass.
Malcolm is sat behind her, and she goes over to him. 
ZIBA
Sorry. For being a bitch. 
MALCOLM
Sorry for ruining your day.
She smiles. 
EXT. STREETS - EVENING 66 66
Now on bikes, Ziba not cycling but sitting behind Malcolm, 
holding on, the gang ride through the evening.78.79.They cycle, and after seeing them all move in tandem, we 
close in on Ziba, the wind in her hair, closing her eyes, 
enjoying the sensation of the warm air on her cheeks.
She rests her head forward, and leans on Malcolm’s back. He 
smiles.
EXT. ALEXANDRA PALACE - EVENING 67 67
The group make it to Ally Pally and dock their bikes. They 
clamber up the steep paths to get to the top.
SHEA
Whose idea was this again?
ZIBA
It’ll be worth it when we get up 
there.
TARA
You will die when you see the view.
Ziba is trailing behind. Tara notices. 
TARA(CONT'D)
Give her a piggy back. 
SHEA
I’ve got a bad back mate.
TARA
Are you eighty? 
SHEA
You try being bent over for 10 
hours a day with your head in a car 
bonnet.
ZIBA
Cry me a river Shea.
MERF
I’ll do it. Zib. Jump on. 
Ziba jumps on to Merf’s back for a piggy back. He walks 
forward. 
19.19
Ziba’s phone buzzes. She looks at it: an alert for the meteor 
shower. An hour to go. She holds her phone in the air.79.80.ZIBA
T MINUS SIXTY MINUTES MOTHAFUCKAS!
SHEA
Does drugs once.
EXT. ALEXANDRA PALACE PARK - DUSK 68 68
The group sit at the top of the hill in a line, looking over 
the horizon as the sun sets over the London skyline.
ZIBA 
Do you think you’re a good person 
Merf?
MERF
What? (Beat) No. 
Merf goes to light his spliff.
MERF(CONT'D)
You know the whole time my Mum was 
in hospital, I only saw her twice. 
Merf takes a drag.
MERF(CONT'D)
And the last time I saw her, she 
asked about my grades. So I lied to 
her. I faked them.
MALCOLM
How?
MERF
Photoshopped the certificates. She 
thinks I got Bs. At least I 
inherited her sense of humour. 
Merf scratches the fold of his arm, over a tattoo of a robin.
MERF(CONT'D)
You could hear her laugh from the 
other side of the street. 
Anyway...hospitals are shit yeah? I 
do not recommend.80.81.EXT. BRENTFORD - DAY - DREAM SEQUENCE OR FLASHFORWARD 69 69
Merf cycles through an underpass with shopping bags perched 
on both sides of his handle bars. He stops to one side to 
take a call. His face falls.

person. 
TARA
Yeah. I think you’re the kindest

What, am I a good person? Erm, I 
don’t know. Probably not (Beat) 
Stole six hundred and forty pounds

INT. ERDANG SCHOOL OF DANCE - DREAM SEQUENCE OR FLASH FORWARD 71 71
Tara, in a leotard, leans over a stretching barre. She goes 
over to her bag, she picks up her ringing phone. She kneels 
down as she takes the call. 
BACK TO:
EXT. ALEXANDRA PALACE PARK - DUSK 72 72
ZIBA 
When?
TARA 
Last summer when I was working at 
the deli. An envelope fell out of 
the delivery guy’s coat and I 
picked it up, and put in my apron.
MERF 
Jesus Tara.81.82.ZIBA
What did you do with it?
TARA
Spent it on clothes, going out, 
stupid shit.
SHEA
I killed a baby chicken when I was 
thirteen.
MERF
What the fuck?
TARA
Ew, Shea.
MALCOLM
Can I ask... how?
SHEA
We were on my aunt’s farm. She had 
these baby chickens running around. 
I grabbed one and held it under a 
stream of water. Just wanted to see 
if I could actually kill something. 
TARA
Jesus Christ Shea. Way to bring the 
mood down.
INT. PRICE & CO GARAGE - DREAM SEQUENCE OR FLASHFORWARD 73 73
Shea, in overalls, fiddles under the bonnet of a car. He’s 
called away by a middle aged woman from the office. He steps 
in to take the call.
BACK TO:
EXT. ALEXANDRA PALACE PARK - DUSK 74 74
SHEA
I wanted to see if I had it in me, 
you know. Turns out I don’t. I 
mean, I killed it. But I hated 
myself for it ever since. 
(beat)
Still have nightmares about that 
stupid bird. 
Tara begins to laugh hysterically, as does Merf. Shea looks 
genuinely sad.82.83.MERF
Go on then Zib. What about you? 
ZIBA
I dunno.
MERF
Nah, nah, nah, it was your 
question.
MALCOLM
C’mon. Let’s hear it.
ZIBA
Erm... I got nothing. Goodie two 
shoes innit.  
Ziba takes the spliff from Shea and takes a drag.
SHEA
Til today.
They all laugh. Ziba then hands it to Malcolm who slowly, 
leaning back and looking to the sky, does the same.
MERF
What are you doing mate?
MALCOLM
Living.
MERF
That’ll show up on a piss test. Are 
you mad? 
MALCOLM
Please just chill the fuck out and 
let me enjoy it? 
Ziba feels bad - she shouldn’t have passed it to him.
ZIBA
Sorry I -
MALCOLM
(coughing)
No it’s fine. Seriously.
MERF
How is it fine?83.84.MALCOLM
My football club won’t find out 
about me smokin weed, because I no

A long beat.
SHEA
Shit.
MALCOLM
Yeah.
TARA
I’m so sorry.
MERF
Are you okay? 
MALCOLM
Yeah. I’m fine. Least my dad wasn’t 
here to see it happen.
(beat)
Last ten years down the drain, as 
my mum put it this morning.
MERF
Bro, why didn’t you say something?
A beat.
MALCOLM
(almost to himself)
You know the season before last I 
got the second most assists? 
Thirteen! Had a few bad games, 
sure, but then they just go and 
drop me. They just let me go. Just 
like that. After 10 fuckin years. 
MERF
They’re making a massive mistake.
SHEA
If it’s any consolation I think 
you’ve got the best right foot of 
anyone here.
Malcolm smiles.
MERF
Not the best left though, that 
would be me.84.85.MALCOLM
Thanks fellas.
A long beat. Malcolm smokes some more.

MALCOLM
The devil’s pancake.

Yes!
Ziba goes to speak but Malcolm interjects.
MALCOLM
Lemme get these. What do you guys 
want? 
ZIBA
Okay. 
Malcolm gets out his phone.
EXT. ALEXANDRA PALACE CAR PARK - LATER 75 75
Malcolm and Ziba walk down the hill to the spot they’re about 
to meet the driver. 85.86.ZIBA
You feeling okay?
MALCOLM
Yeah. Think so.
(beat)
Thanks for letting me tag along 
today. 
ZIBA
Didn’t really have a choice.
MALCOLM
Oh, it’s like that, is it?
ZIBA
I’m just messing. You’re okay?
MALCOLM
Yeah. Just got to figure out what 
the fuck I do now. 
ZIBA
Yeah, know what you mean.
MALCOLM
Huh? 
ZIBA
No just - all change right now 
isn’t it?
MALCOLM
You’ve got UCL waiting for you. 
ZIBA
Yeah, well. (Changing the subject) 
You sure I can’t get these?
MALCOLM
Already done, my treat.
She looks at him.
He smiles. 
The PIZZA DELIVERY MAN turns up on his moped and stops 
outside the entrance.
PIZZA DELIVERY MAN
For Malcolm.
MALCOLM
That’s me.86.87.He gets off the bike and takes all their boxes out. Malcolm 
shifts from side to side, nervous.
The Delivery Man hands Malcolm the boxes. He rides off.
MALCOLM(CONT'D)
Ziba - I - 
Ziba leans in and kisses him. 
SHOT: Extreme wide of Malcolm, holding a pile of pizza boxes 
while twisting his neck to kiss Ziba, in the empty car park, 
against the building and telecommunications tower.
Malcolm stops for a moment, looking into her eyes.
ZIBA
Come with me.
Ziba leads Malcolm to a quiet patch in the dark, through 
trees, silent, not lit.
Malcolm, still holding the pizza boxes nearly trips and 
laughs. Ziba laughs too, then says:
ZIBA(CONT'D)
Shhh.
They find a quiet, secluded area. Malcolm puts the boxes 
down.
They begin to make out. 
They kiss, touching each other’s bodies, getting heated.
Ziba reaches for Malcolm’s crotch. He stops for a moment.
MALCOLM
Not here -
ZIBA
Please.
After a slight hesitation:
MALCOLM
Are you sure?
ZIBA
Yes. 
Malcolm looks around, as Ziba slides her underwear off from 
under her skirt, she leans back against a tree.87.88.ZIBA(CONT'D)
I’m sure.
Ziba assumes he’ll do the same, but instead he kneels down. 
He begins to go down on her, but we stay with Ziba. She looks 
to the sky. 
Ziba pulls Malcolm up to her face, and kisses him. He 
unbuckles his belt and lowers his shorts. Malcolm kisses 
Ziba’s neck as she wraps her legs around his waist. 
Blood begins to drip from her nose. Malcolm moves up her neck 
to her mouth. He stops, and pushes himself off the tree. 
ZIBA(CONT'D)
Wait. What...why d’you stop?
Malcolm wipes a spec of blood from his cheek.
MALCOLM
(Without making eye 
contact)
Your nose is bleeding.
ZIBA
What?
Ziba touches the bottom of her nose, and sees the blood on 
her finger.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
Fucking perfect. 
MALCOLM
Are you okay? 
ZIBA
I’m fine. It’s fine - we can keep 
going - 
MALCOLM
I think maybe we should - 
Malcolm stands up. Ziba suddenly gets angry. 
ZIBA
We should what? 
A beat. 
MALCOLM
It’s not just a nosebleed is it?  88.89.Another beat. Ziba feeling a hundred different emotions at 
once. 
MALCOLM(CONT'D)
Is it?
ZIBA
Fuck off. 
MALCOLM
Ziba.
ZIBA
Who the fuck are you?
Malcolm looks at her.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
Just a washed-up footballer whose 
career is over before it even 
started. 
Ziba wipes her nose with her hand. Malcolm looks down at the 
floor.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
Don’t tell me what to do.
Ziba storms off, leaving Malcolm stood alone in the dark. 
He notices a piece of paper fall out of her back and bends 
down to pick it up. 
MALCOLM
Wait...
He unfolds the paper, winces to read it in the dark.
11.59 - Westminster Bridge. 
EXT. ALEXANDRA PALACE - MOMENTS LATER 76 76
The squad perches on a wall, grabbing slices from two large 
pizza boxes. Other groups have now gathered, ready to watch, 
some with telescopes and binoculars. Ziba walks over to them, 
stashing the itinerary in her bag, and joining them to sit 
down. 
TARA
Thanks for getting these, they’re 
delish.89.90.MERF
Yeah, cheers Zib.
Ziba acknowledges this with a veiled smile as she sits. 
ZIBA
Wasn’t me.
Her phone alarm begins to ring, loudly.
20.11
Ziba turns off the alarm, as she looks out over the London 
skyline, wiping her eye.
ZIBA(CONT'D)
Any second now.
MERF
Where should we be looking?
Track: Perseid Shower by Federico Albanese.
Malcolm arrives behind them, sitting down awkwardly too. As 
he does so, he hands Ziba the piece of paper subtly. She 
sneaks a peek at it and we see the words at the bottom of the 
page, in her handwriting. Shit.
Merf, Shea, and Tara more spread out now, look out over the 
horizon, phones in hand, ready and waiting to film the 
action. The crowd amassed in the park goes silent.
SHOT: Slow zoom into an XCU of Ziba’s eyeball. As we move 
toward her iris we can make out what appears to be a cluster 
of shooting stars moving across the sky. 
SHOT: Extreme wide, from behind the crowd, as the cluster 
lights up the sky, travelling toward us. The cluster is made 
up of one large object followed by four smaller objects, and 
a cackle of smaller rocks, all ablaze. 
They all look up, their faces glow red, as the perseid shower 
flies directly above them, and behind them, and eventually 
out of view. A stream of smoke from the shower’s flight path 
remains. 
Ziba looks ahead at the sky, disappointment in her eyes.
ZIBA
I guess that’s it then.90.91.SHEA
(not hearing her)
Not gonna lie, that was fuckin’ 
live.
MERF
Mad!
MALCOLM
Thanks for organising Ziba.
She ignores him, looking despondent.
SHEA
For real, that was sick.
TARA
I thought it was gonna hit the 
earth but it just flew above and 
kept going and going and going. 
ZIBA
If you’re ready I’ll call a cab to 
take you all back west.
TARA
Us? What about you?
ZIBA
I’ve got somewhere I need to go.
SHEA
What you on about? 
ZIBA
I’ll book you a cab now. 
MERF
I’m kinda buzzin’ right now man.
SHEA
Could hit that printworks party? 
MALCOLM
(a bit desperate - 
glancing at Ziba)
Yeah - why would we end the night 
now? It’s still early. 
TARA
Zib?
SHEA
Zib 2.0. C’mon.91.92.ZIBA
I’m really tired.
TARA
So tired you ain’t going home?
MALCOLM
Didn’t you say you don’t have to 
queue Shea?
Malcolm and Ziba share a glance: did he read it? 
SHEA
Not if we leave now.
TARA
I mean to be fair to her it’s not 
on the itinerary...
Tara laughs. Ziba looks at Malcolm. Thinks for a moment. 
Her phone rings: her mum. She looks at it, and rejects the 
call.
ZIBA
Fuck the itinerary. 
(beat)
How much is it to get in?
SHEA
Probably twenty quid. 
Ziba pulls out her wad of cash and hands it to Shea.

a hundred and twenty, a hundred and

summer’s night.

EXT. FINSBURY PARK TUBE STATION - NIGHT 78 78
Ziba steps forward to the edge of the platform. She closes 
her eyes as a gust of wind lifts up her hair. 
Suddenly Malcolm is holding her arm, pulling her back. She 
opens her eyes.
MALCOLM
Careful. 
Ziba looks at him. Smiles - a sort of gratitude. He smiles 
back. 
INT. NORTHERN LINE - NIGHT 79 79
The boys sit on a row of seats on one side, the girls on the 
other. Tara eyes up a MAN IN A SUIT. Tara nudges Ziba.
TARA
You know I’ve always wanted to fuck 
a banker. 
The man hears what she says and bristles, going slightly red 
in the neck from embarrassment. 
ZIBA
Taz. 
TARA
A Wall Street type. Fuck him good.
ZIBA
Keep your voice down, he can hear 
us.
TARA
Men have got away with saying dirty 
things about women in public 
forever. Our turn innit?
ZIBA
(Laughing)
I’m gonna miss you Taz.93.94.TARA
What d’you mean miss me? You’re

at the suited man and blows him a kiss as she exits. 
TARA

INT. LONDON BRIDGE ESCALATOR - NIGHT 80 80
Tara rummages in her bag on the escalator, the group behind 
her. Malcolm is now behind Ziba, the tension palpable.

shut.

she looks away.

INT. PRINTWORKS, FANTASY SEQUENCE - NIGHT 82 82
Ziba stood, in the middle of the dance floor, lights 
flashing, music pumping, as she swirls around, the rest of 
the dancers moving back and back, as she creates space around 
her. 
She holds the pill cocktail bottle in her hands, she looks to 
it. She is floating up, still, elevated from the ground, 
dancing, ethereal. She hears Mona’s voice.
MONA (V.O.)
(subtitled)
Zibi Joon... My baby... Ziba... 
EXT. PRINTWORKS, PRESENT - NIGHT 83 83
The queue isn’t moving.

TARA
Zib?
ZIBA
I need a drink so bad. That tube 
was an oven. 
SHEA
There’s a shop over there.
Malcolm, looking at Ziba, trying to be helpful:
MALCOLM
I’l get some water. 
MERF
Get some road beers too. 
Tara is back on her phone, annoyed at the queue. Malcolm 
makes a final glance at Ziba. 
MALCOLM
Alright, back in a minute.95.96.Malcolm zig-zags through the crowd, he runs across the road 
towards the supermarket when - 
He’s STRUCK by a motorbike. 
He goes flying. 
Tara SHRIEKS.
The group run, slow motion, to Malcolm. 
Time seems to slow down around us and we focus on Ziba. 
She hears events unfold around her, but her focus is on 
Malcolm, lying on the ground, blood appearing around his 
legs.
We snap back to real time:
TARA
Fuck fuck fuck fuck -
SHEA
That ain’t helpful! 
TARA
What are we gonna do? 
MERF
Call a fucking ambulance!
ZIBA
I’ll go with him -

I’ll go with him alright? 
They share a tense look. 
INT. AMBULANCE - [DRIVING] - NIGHT - LATER 84 84
An ambulance siren rings loudly as Ziba watches a flurry of 
activity from within a traveling ambulance. An unconscious 
Malcolm lies on a stretcher, with paramedics busy at work, we

watches on.

The gang sit in the waiting room. Tara paces up and down. 
Shea is on the phone to someone. Malcolm and Ziba sit on 
chairs.
TARA
Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
MERF
Once again, I’m not sure that’s 
helping.
TARA
Why didn’t he look both ways? 
SHEA
He’d had a bit to drink - we’ve all 
had a bit to drink.
MERF
He’s a lightweight.
TARA
Fuck. 
Merf hangs up the phone. 
MERF

ZIBA
Back in a second.
INT. ROYAL LONDON HOSPITAL - DISABLED TOILET - MOMENTS LATER 87 87
Ziba sits on the toilet and cries. Sobs. 
She takes out her itinerary. She looks at it. Begins to peel 
segments of the paper off, line by line, item by item, all 
the things they’ve done that day.
She reaches the final piece. The bridge. 
CUT TO:
INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT 88 88
A FLASH back to snippets of Malcolm’s bloody, injured body -  
visceral, grim. Nothing like the fantasy flashes before. 
CUT BACK TO:
INT. ROYAL LONDON HOSPITAL - DISABLED TOILET - SAME 89 89
Ziba looks like she’s going to be sick. She stands up 
quickly, opens the toilet lid, and retches. 
She sits on the floor, looking at the strip of paper, 
signifying the end of everything. She puts the other strips 
of paper into the toilet and flushes.
She considers putting in the final strip - but stops - 
conflicted, confused. She puts it in her pocket. 
She stands up, leaves the cubicle and goes over to the sink, 
where she splashes cold water on her face.
She looks in the mirror. 
INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT 90 90
Another FLASH - this time it’s ZIBA who is sat injured and 
bloody. In pain, struggling.

are now joined by TONYA.
CONSULTANT
(to Ziba)
Hi.
(continuing)
Malcolm is now out of emergency 
surgery and stabilised. You can 
visit him in the next hour or so, 
maybe two of you at a time to keep 
things calm. 
Tonya breaks down. He sobs. Tara is crying too. And Shea. 
Merf has a tear in his eye. 
TONYA
Thank you doctor. And he’ll fully 
recover?
SHEA
What about football? He’s a player 
Doc, a really good one. 
CONSULTANT
I’m afraid I can’t comment on that 
at this point. But physio can work 
wonders these days. 
(beat)
I’ll let you know as soon as 
there’s any developments. 
The consultant leaves and the group huddle together. They 
have a group embrace. Tara gestures for Ziba to join. She 
does.
SHEA
Happy fucking results day guys.
After a moment of silence, they laugh, infectious, 
overwhelmed by the course of the day. 99.100.INT. ROYAL LONDON HOSPITAL - ICU - NIGHT - LATER 93 93
Ziba walks towards Malcolm’s room and sees Merf and Shea 
leaving. Silently, Merf puts a hand on Ziba’s shoulder, and 
Shea nods. 
Ziba walks inside to find Tonya sit next to Malcolm, who’s 
asleep, his leg up in a cast and braces, connected to lots of 
tubes and wires, but alive and breathing.
Tonya has been holding his hand, and now stands up.
TONYA
I’m just popping to the bathroom.
Ziba nods: okay. She’s left alone with him. She moves to his 
side and reaches for his hand. He takes it. His eyes slowly 
open.
MALCOLM
Hey.
ZIBA
Hi.
ZIBA (V.O.)
Really, really not part of the 
plan. 
He motions for Ziba to move closer.
MALCOLM
This is the strangest first date 
I’ve ever been on.
ZIBA
Was this a date?
He tries to laugh but it hurts. Ziba moves closer.
MALCOLM
I’m just playin’. For real though, 
thanks for today. Best thing that 
could’ve happened to me I reckon. 
ZIBA
What d’you mean?
Tonya arrives back at the door and Ziba pulls her hand away.

her pocket and takes it into her hand. 
EXT. CHISWICK STATION PLATFORM - LATER 96 96
As the group exit the train the piece of paper in Ziba’s hand 
flies away. She’s panicked. It slips between the gap and she 
looks to go and fetch it but it’s too late.
Tired, Tara gives her a look: are you okay? Ziba nods and 
keeps walking. 
CHISWICK STATION ENTRANCE/EXIT - MORNING - CONTINUOUS 97 97

Ziba and Tara stroll down the street.
SHOT: Long lens as the girls arrive at the top of Wilmington 
Avenue. Before Ziba turns down her road she stops to face 
Tara. She confesses something inaudible to us, but clearly of 
importance. 
SHOT: The same shot, from the same distance, except the girls 
are their younger 9 year old selves. Ziba whispers something 
into Tara’s ear, they laugh uncontrollably.

The two girls stand there, hugging. Ziba breaks away, and 
turns the corner into Wilmington Avenue.

home.

From the corridor, we see the back of Mona’s head as she sits 
at the dining table, head in her hands. She reaches for her 
phone, and her diary. We hear the sound of a dial-tone.

INT. ZIBA’S BEDROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 101 101
Ziba enters her room and quietly closes the door. She 
approaches a vinyl player, lifts up the lid before taking a 
vinyl out of its sleeve. She drops the needle and puts on her 
large-set headphones. 
She turns her backpack upside down. A wallet, bank notes, 
coins, a make-up compact, a folded itinerary, a water bottle 
and crucially the whiskey miniature fall onto the floor. 
SHOT: ZIBA’S POV OF THE ITEMS ON THE FLOOR.
She picks up the whiskey miniature and settles into her brown 
leather desk chair. The music fades in. 
It’s “Eshveh” by Bijan Mortazavi.
Ziba takes the miniature, and playfully gives it a shake. 
While unscrewing the bottle cap, she looks at the books all 
around her, remnants of her passions, her hard work, her 
future.104.105.Her phone vibrates, interrupting her thoughts. She picks it 
up off the desk.
Ziba laughs, smiles, despite herself. She puts the miniature 
down onto her desk, and starts to text back. She looks up to 
think of a witty response, until she shifts her attention to 
us. Ziba stares right down the barrel.
ZIBA’s POV: A slow zoom into a framed photograph of The Blue 
Marble.
We can hear the faint music coming through her headphones. 
Ziba smiles, and then relaxes. 
SHOT: C/U of Ziba from POV of framed picture of The Blue 
Marble.
Still looking at us/The Blue Marble she smiles once more. 
It’s a beautiful smile, bittersweet but genuine. Her right 
nostril begins to stream blood. Just before the track’s 
violin introduction we FADE TO BLACK.
