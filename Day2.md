## What Are Word Embeddings for Text?

#### https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-word-embeddings/

* Word embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation.

* Word embeddings are a class of techniques where individual words are represented as real-valued vectors in a predefined vector space. Each word is mapped to one vector and the vector values are learned in a way that resembles a neural network

* associate with each word in the vocabulary a distributed word feature vector â€¦ The feature vector represents different aspects of the word: each word is associated with a point in a vector space. - https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf

* words that are used in similar ways to result in having similar representations - https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00437956.1954.11659520

* Word embedding methods learn a real-valued vector representation for a predefined fixed sized vocabulary from a corpus of text. The learning process is either joint with the neural network model on some task, such as document classification, or is an unsupervised process, using document statistics.
