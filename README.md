# AI-Line-Producer

This project is an experimental idea on building an AI that can act as a line producer for independent movie budgets. The goal of this AI is to break down a script scene by scene, estimate the cost of each scene, and format the budget similar to the movie budget document created by a line producer.

Additional capabilities can include: creating graphs and charts for budget analysis, creating timelines using budget analysis, create action plans and goal settings based on budget.
