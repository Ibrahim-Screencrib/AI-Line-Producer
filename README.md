# AI-Line-Producer

This project is an experimental idea on building an AI that can act as a line producer for independent movie budgets.
### Goal:
* Break down a script scene by scene 
* estimate the cost of each scene
* format the budget similar to the movie budget document created by a line producer

### Additional capabilities 
* creating graphs and charts for budget analysis
* creating timelines using budget analysis
* create action plans and goal settings based on budget
