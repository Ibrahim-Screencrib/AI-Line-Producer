# Tax Credit Tool

This tool uses a movie script to find the most appropriate locations to film in. Showing the producers the available tax credits for shooting their films will help them save a significant amount of funding on their film

## Breakdown of Tool

Creating a tool like this involves several steps and requires a combination of different technologies. Here's a rough outline of the steps involved and the expectations:

* Script Analysis: The first step would be to parse the movie script and identify the locations or areas mentioned. This would involve Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and as you mentioned, the Spacy module would be a good choice for this task. It has built-in Named Entity Recognition (NER) capabilities that can identify locations in text.

* Location Suggestions: Once the locations are identified, the tool will need to suggest suitable filming locations. This would involve matching the climate and visual aesthetics described in the script with actual locations. This could be a challenging task as it involves subjective interpretation of the script and objective data about various locations. It might require a combination of NLP techniques and data analysis.

* Film Tax Credit Rate Analysis: The tool will also need to consider the film tax credit rate. This would involve parsing a .csv file and matching the locations with the data in the file. This is a relatively straightforward task and can be done using data analysis libraries.

* Web Scraping: The tool will need to follow links to official websites to find more information about the film tax credits and eligibility requirements. This would involve web scraping, which can be done using libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy in Python.

* Integration: Finally, all these components need to be integrated into a single tool. This would involve designing a user interface, handling user inputs, and presenting the results in a user-friendly manner.

As for the development stack, Python would be a good choice for this project. It has strong support for NLP with libraries like Spacy, data analysis with libraries like pandas, and web scraping with libraries like BeautifulSoup. For the user interface, a web-based interface could be created using a framework like Flask or Django. If a desktop application is preferred, PyQt or Tkinter could be used.

## Software Architecture

The tool you described would likely follow a multi-tier architecture, specifically a three-tier architecture, which is a common structure for modern web applications. Here's how it would break down:

* Presentation Layer (Front-End): This is the user interface where users interact with the tool. It could be a web-based interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or a desktop application built with PyQt or Tkinter.

* Application Layer (Back-End): This is where the main logic of the application resides. In your case, this would include the script analysis, location suggestions, film tax credit rate analysis, and web scraping. This layer would be built with Python, using libraries like Spacy, pandas, and BeautifulSoup.

* Data Layer: This is where the data used by the application is stored and retrieved. In your case, this could include the movie script, the .csv file with film tax credit rates, and possibly a database to store information about various locations.

This architecture separates concerns, making the application easier to develop, maintain, and scale. The front-end and back-end can be developed independently, and changes in one layer don't necessarily affect the others. For example, you could switch from a web-based interface to a desktop application without changing the back-end logic.

In terms of specific architectural patterns within the back-end, the tool could use a combination of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Model-View-Controller (MVC). The script analysis, location suggestions, film tax credit rate analysis, and web scraping could be implemented as separate services within the SOA. The MVC pattern could be used to separate the data (model), user interface (view), and application logic (controller) within each service.

## Timeline:

* **Script Analysis:** Developing the NLP capabilities to analyze the script and identify locations could take a few weeks. This includes time for training and fine-tuning the model, as well as testing and validation.

* **Location Suggestions:** Developing the logic to suggest suitable filming locations based on the script and other data could also take a few weeks. This includes time for data collection and analysis, as well as developing and testing the matching algorithm.

* **Film Tax Credit Rate Analysis:** Parsing the .csv file and matching the locations with the data could take a few days to a week, depending on the complexity of the data.

* **Web Scraping:** Developing the web scraping capabilities to follow links and extract information could take a week or two, depending on the complexity of the websites.

* **Integration and User Interface:** Integrating all the components and developing the user interface could take a few weeks. This includes time for designing the interface, implementing the design, and testing the integrated system.

* **Testing and Debugging:** After the initial development, there should be a period of testing and debugging to ensure the tool works as expected and to fix any issues. This could take a few weeks.

* **Documentation and Deployment:** Finally, there should be time for writing documentation, setting up the deployment environment, and deploying the tool. This could take a week or two.

## Resources

### **Programming Languages:**

**Python:** Python is a versatile language with strong support for data analysis, NLP, and web scraping. It's also relatively easy to learn and use, which makes it a good choice for this project.

### **Libraries and Tools:**

**Spacy:** Spacy is a powerful library for NLP in Python. It has built-in capabilities for named entity recognition, which you can use to identify locations in the movie script.

**Pandas:** Pandas is a data analysis library in Python. You can use it to parse the .csv file with film tax credit rates and match the locations with the data.

**BeautifulSoup or Scrapy:** These are libraries for web scraping in Python. You can use them to follow links to official websites and extract information about the film tax credits and eligibility requirements.

**Flask or Django:** These are web frameworks in Python. You can use them to develop the user interface for the tool.

**PyQt or Tkinter:** If you prefer a desktop application, you can use PyQt or Tkinter to develop the user interface.

### **Data:**

**Movie Script:** You would need a movie script to test and validate the tool.

**.csv File with Film Tax Credit Rates:** The tool will use a .csv file with film tax credit rates. You would need to prepare this file.

**Information about Locations:** The tool will need data about various locations to suggest suitable filming locations. This could include data about the climate, visual aesthetics, culture, and other relevant factors. You might need to collect this data from various sources.
