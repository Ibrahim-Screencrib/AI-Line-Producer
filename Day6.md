# Day 6 Notes

## Observations
* When characters are talking the authors of the script often put on accents within the script. Ex. Last Swim 'Berrgerr King' or 'Subvay' these will mess up the Script because even though these are real locations they are spelt weirdly.
    * solution: ignore any character dialogue when analyzing the script
    * so clean up the PDF, (if only we had a tool to extract a script without character dialogue?)

* After cleaning the output from our extraction methods they are still a couple of errors.
    * Lets clean it up further with regex

* Now we have a (mostly) cleaned list of locations, lets compare them to the .csv locations to see if we get a match?
    * I wish that within every country we could know if one of the notable landmarks in the country matched one of the locations from the script
