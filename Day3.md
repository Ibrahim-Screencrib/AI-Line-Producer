* The script breakdown is a crucial pre-production step for determining your filmâ€™s budget and production schedule
    * you will be breaking down each scene, marking important elements required for the shoot.

* Split the script into 8ths. Generally, one page of your script equals one minute of screentime. 

* Mark all the important elements on the page

* I thought this article was interesting in terms of using machine learning to learn similarities between words. Maybe that could be applied?

* Has some cool info on using word embeddings to find synonyms

So far it seems like the screenplay-parser is the one to use. I would also explore ScreenPy

The screenplay/parser
* it can only parse certain types of files, not .pdfs or .txts
* it doesn't parse props correctly. It is good with characters and locations and scenes.

* it looks pretty broken except for the scenes and characters
